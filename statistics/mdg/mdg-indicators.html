						<p>Data availability and applicability of MDG indicators</p>

						<p>The assessment made on the availability and applicability of the MDG indicators in the Philippines showed that out of the 48 indicators, 29 could be obtained from the various government surveys and administrative records; 8 indicators are not available; and 11 are found not applicable in the Philippines. For some of the 8 indicators which are not available, there are international organizations such as the UNAIDS, WHO, World Bank, and International Telecommunications Unit (ITU) which have country estimates on these indicators.</p>

						<p>The 11 indicators which are not applicable in the Philippines fall under Goal 8 â€“ Develop a Global Partnership for Development. Some of these indicators are more relevant to least developed countries (LDCs), Africa, landlocked countries, small island developing States, and HIPs.</p>

						<p>In the Philippines, the assessment and compilation of MDG Indicators were done as part of the participation of the NSCB in the Workshop on Development Indicators held in Manila, Philippines in October 2001 and 2002 organized by the UNSD through the "United Nations Project on Strengthening Regional Capacities for Statistical Development in Southeast Asia."</p>

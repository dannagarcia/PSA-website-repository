				<h4>Seven out of ten crimes committed in CAR are index crimes</h4>

				<p>Based on the data from the Police Regional Office-Cordillera, almost three-fourths (73.5%) of the crimes committed in 2008 were index crimes (i.e., murder, robbery, physical injury, theft and rape). Only 26.4 percent of all offenses perpetrated in the region were non-index crimes (i.e., estafa, illegal drugs, libel, gambling, etc.).</p>

				<p>The bulk of the index crimes in the region were committed against persons (57.1%) with more than half of these as physical injuries (55.5%). Murder and rape still posed a serious concern with 18.0 and 17.1 percent respectively. Among the 360 reported cases of crimes against property, which comprised 42.9 percent of all index crimes, 59.7 percent was theft while 40.3 percent was robbery.</p>

				<p>This October 2009, the nation celebrates the 20th National Statistics Month with the theme: “Enhancing Security Sector Statistics for Good Governance, Peace and Sustainable Development”. In general, the observance of this event has two-fold objectives, viz: (a) to promote, enhance, and instill nationwide awareness and appreciation of the importance and value of statistics to the different sectors of society, and (b) to elicit the cooperation and support of the general public in upgrading the quality and standards of statistics in the country.</p>

				<p>CRIME STATISTICS TERMS:</p>
				<p>INDEX CRIMES – crimes that are serious in nature and that occur with sufficient frequency and regularity such that they can serve as an index to the crime situation. Considered only are the crimes of murder, homicide, physical injury (serious and less serious), carnapping, cattle rustling, robbery, theft and rape.</p>
				<p>NON-INDEX CRIMES – are violations of special laws such as illegal logging or local ordinances.</p>
				<p>SOLVED CASES – a case shall be considered solved when the following elements occur: (1) The offender has been identified; there is sufficient evidence to charge the person; the offender has been taken into custody; and the offender has been charged before the prosecutor’s office or court of appropriate jurisdiction. (2) A case is considered solved when some elements beyond police control prevent the arrest of the offender, such as when the victim refuses to prosecute after the offender is identified or offender dies or absconds. (3) The arrest of one offender can solve several crimes or several offenders may be arrested in the process of solving one crime.</p>
				<p>CLEARED CASES – a case shall be considered cleared when at least one of the offenders has been identified; there is sufficient evidence to charge the person; and the person has been charged before the prosecutor’s office or any other court of appropriate jurisdiction. Included in this category are solved cases.</p><br>

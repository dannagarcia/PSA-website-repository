				<p>Industry rebounded from negative 3.9 percent in 2012 to 4.1 percent in 2013 due largely to the double-digit growth posted by all its subsectors except Manufacturing. Construction grew the fastest at 17.2 percent followed by Electricity, Gas and Water Supply (EGWS) at 16.9 percent. The growth in the Construction subsector was due to increased private and public construction while EGWS growth was due to the improved performance of the power sector. Mining and Quarrying bounced back from negative 54.8 percent in 2012 to surge by 12.7 percent in 2013 due to the increased production in metallic minerals.</p>

				<p>
				Manufacturing turned around from negative 2.1 percent to 1.4 percent last year due to the output from the export processing zone. On the other hand, other subsectors continued to grow but at a slower pace in 2013.</p>

				<p>
				Services accelerated from 7.9 percent in 2012 to 9.6 percent in 2013 due largely to the higher growth of Real Estate, Renting and Business Activities (RERBA) and the continuous growth of all subsectors. RERBA surged by 19.7 percent attributed to the increase in real estate transactions and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) activities. Financial Intermediation sped up by 14.7 percent due to vibrant banking activity. Other Services and Public Administration and Defense also accelerated by 6.6 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively during the period. On the other hand, other subsectors continued to grow but at a slower pace in 2013.</p>

				GRDP is the measure of goods and services produced in each of the 17 geo-political regions of the country. It is the regional dimension of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and is estimated annually by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). </p>

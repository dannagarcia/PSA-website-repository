				<p>FWBDs are among the most common causes of diarrhea, resulting from the ingestion of contaminated food or water.1/ The top three FWBDs in Baguio during the period were gastroenteritis, typhoid fever and amebiasis.</p>

The highest number of reported gastroenteritis cases was recorded in 2009 with 1,733 cases.

				<p>Amebiasis in the city has declined from 47 cases in 2005 to 29 cases in 2010. It is an infection of the intestines with amebae, associated with frequent, loose stools with blood and mucus. 4/</p>

				<p>Leptospirosis remains low with only five (5) reported cases in 2010.

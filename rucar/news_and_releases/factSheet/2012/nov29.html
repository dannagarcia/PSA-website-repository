				<h4>One in every 10 school children in CAR is overweight</h4>

				<p>A recent survey of the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the Department of Science and Technology (FNRI-DOST) reveals that 10.8 percent of school children (5.1-10.0 years old) and 5.3 percent of pre-schoolers (5 years old and below) in the Cordilleras were overweight in 2011. Both figures are higher than the national overweight prevalence rate for school children of 7.5 percent and for pre-schoolers of 4.3 percent . These are based on the findings of the 2011 Survey on Updating the Nutritional Status of Filipino Children and Other Population Groups of FNRI-DOST.</p>

				<p>Nationwide, the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) had the least number of underweight children in the country in 2011 at 17.9 percent among school children and 11.9 percent for pre-school children. Both figures are much lower than the national underweight prevalence rate for school children of 32.0 percent and for pre-schoolers of 20.2 percent .</p>

				<p>The survey also showed that the proportion of stunted school children in CAR at 32.2 percent was lower than the national average of 33.6 percent . However, the proportion of underheight pre-schoolers in CAR of 34.2 percent was above the national average of 33.6 percent .</p>

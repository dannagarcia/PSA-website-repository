					<tr>
						<td><p>ARD Baliang again stressed the importance of statistics in DA. Dir. Baliang also shared the schedule of the various NSM activities scheduled for October 2005. ARD Dacanay discussed the legal basis of the NSM and elaborated on the competitive advantage of CAR as a Greens and Ornamental Grocer under the Regional Development Plan. He cited the challenge of low productivity in the agricultural sector. For instance, while the agriculture and fishery sector accounts for more than half of the labor force, it produces less than 15 percent of the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP). In contrast, the industrial sector employs less than 10 percent of the work force but generates nearly two-thirds of the GRDP. Mr. Yabes informed the public that rice and corn production grew substantially in 2004 and also gave an overview on the mandate and functions of BAS. RD Gulla responded to some inquiries on civil registry matters and on the Census of Agriculture and Fisheries (CAF). Mr. Navarro shared data on the 2004 GRDP and the 2003 Poverty Statistics as estimated by the NSCB. He reported that in the year 2003, 1 in every 4 families lived below the poverty threshold in CAR. In closing, he emphasized the need by the public to participate not only in the NSM activities slated for October 2005 but to support the various surveys and censuses conducted by the statistical system. Dir. Gulla also expressed the hope that the public will favorably support the surveys of the NSO and other statistical agencies and concluded that “sa tamang bilang, higit ang pakinabang.”</p></td>

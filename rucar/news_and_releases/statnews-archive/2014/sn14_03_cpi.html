				<p><h4>CAR celebrates the 25th National Statistics Month</h4></p>

				<p>The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is on track in 9 out of 27 or 33.3 percent of the available indicators* of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). CAR has made significant strides in the reduction of poverty and hunger (Goal 1) and the combat against malaria (Goal 6). However, the Cordillera region has a low probability of achieving 11 MDG targets and a medium probability of meeting 7 other MDG targets. This is according to the latest MDG Watch prepared by the Philippine Statistics Authority (National Statistical Coordination Board-CAR).</p>

				<p>Among the CAR provinces, Mountain Province has the most number of MDG targets that could be attained with 9 out of 21 target rates with a high probability of being achieved by 2015. The province has made notable improvements particularly in the eradication of poverty and hunger (Goal 1) and the improvement in access to safe water supply and sanitation (Goal 7). However, like the rest of the region, the achievement of universal primary education (Goal 2) remains elusive. (See the <a href="http://www.nscb.gov.ph/rucar/pdf/mdgwatch/mdg%20watch%202014-%20MT.%20PROVINCE.pdf"> MDG Watch of Mt. Province.)</a></p>

				<img width="100%" src="/images/statnews/sn2014-mdg.png">

				<p>The provinces of Benguet, Abra, Apayao and Kalinga have a low probability of achieving more than half of their MDG targets by 2015.</p>

				<p>The MDG is a set of time-bound and measurable goals and targets for combating poverty, hunger, diseases, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women. The MDG Watch is an information sheet showing the progress of the region, province or municipality towards the attainment of the MDG. The infosheet features baseline data, target rates, latest available data and the probability of attainment.</p>

				<p>Data sources of the MDG Watch include the Philippine Statistics Authority, Food and Nutrition Institute of the Department of Science and Technology, National Nutrition Council, Department of Health, Department of Education, Commission on Higher Education, Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the National Telecommunications Commission.</p>

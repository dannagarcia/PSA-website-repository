					<p><b class="fg-amber">MINERAL RESOURCES</b></p>
					<p class="align-justify">Minerals are natural substances extracted through the process of mining. Compared to other natural resources, the mineral resource is unique because: 1) its special features are initially unknown, fixed in size and location and variable in quality; 2) mineral reserves are dynamic and 3) minerals resources are non-renewable.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is the country's major source of gold and copper. In 1998, the region had an estimated metallic reserve of 164.52 MT of gold and 6.67 million MT of copper.  Moreover, non-metallic reserves such as limestone and sand and gravel materials are also found in economic quantities in the region.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">At the beginning of 1990, gold reserves in ore form were estimated at 6.53 million MT which is equivalent to about 41.48 MT of metal. The reserves for the eight-year period generally show an increasing trend averaging about 23.8 percent annually. The steady increase is attributed to new discoveries made as a result of exploration activities. At the end of 1998, gold reserves reached 37.31 million MT. Between 1990 and 1998, a total of 11.41 million MT of gold ore containing 33.68 MT of metal was extracted. On the average, this is equivalent to a yearly extraction of 1.27 million MT of gold ore.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Copper in ore form opened with 1.08 billion MT and closed at 1.09 billion MT in 1990. These reserves moved up further to 1.45 billion MT in 1998 at an annual average growth rate of 3.63 percent.  From the 12.2 billion MT copper ore reserves, about 55.1 million MT of metal has been recovered between 1990 and 1998. Stocks were at its highest in 1993 after which reserves declined although not in the same magnitudes as that observed from 1990-1992. Metal extraction was at its highest levels from 1990-1994. Slowdown in extraction activities manifested itself starting 1995 and on to 1998 during which volume extracted declined annually by 34 percent on the average.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Limestone reserves decreased from 1.27 million MT in 1990 to only 1.07 million MT in 1998. In 1990, reserves opened at 1 million MT and closed at 1.27 million MT of which extractions reached 21 thousand MT. Reserves declined 2.1 percent annually thereafter on the average until stocks closed at 1.07 million MT. Extractions showed an erratic trend, averaging 23 thousand MT annually. It peaked in 1993, after which it tapered off in the next two years, accelerated in 1996 and slid down again in 1997 and 1998.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">During the period under study, gold and copper mining operations went through a volatile movement in operations with operating surpluses diving down in 1991 to 1994 and 1996 and recovering in 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1990, mining suffered a setback in the aftermath of the July killer earthquake, which seriously disrupted mining operations. Cost control characterized the industry in 1993 as companies drastically reduced extraction activities with a number of companies reducing production if not suspending operations. Year 1995 was eventful as this saw the first year's effect of the reduction of the excise taxes on gold and copper. By 1997 and 1998, operating surpluses improved substantially especially in the former as output levels shot up in the face of the continuing increase in production costs.</p>

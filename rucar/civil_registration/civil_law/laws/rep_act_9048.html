				<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress  assembled:</p>
				<p>
					<strong>SECTION 1. Authority to Correct Clerical or Typographical Error and Change of First Name or Nickname -</strong> No entry in a civil register shall be changed or corrected without a judicial order, except for clerical or typographical errors and change of first name or nickname which can be corrected or changed by the concerned city or municipal civil registrar or consul general in accordance with the provisions of this Act and its implementing rules and regulations.
				</p>

				<p><strong>SECTION 2. Definition of Terms</strong> - As used in this Act, the following terms shall mean:</p>
				
				<ol><li><strong>"City or Municipal civil registrar" </strong>refers to the head of the local civil registry office of the city or municipality, as the case may be, who is appointed as such by the city or municipal mayor in accordance with the provisions of existing laws.</li>
				<li><strong>"Petitioner"</strong> refers to a natural person filing the petition and who has direct and personal interest in the correction of a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change of first name or nickname in the civil register.</li>
				<li><strong>"Clerical or typographical error"</strong> refers to a mistake committed in the performance of clerical work in writing, copying, transcribing or typing an entry in the civil register that is harmless and innocuous, such as misspelled name or misspelled place of birth or the like, which is visible to the eyes or obvious to the understanding, and can be corrected or changed only by reference to other existing record or records: Provided, however, That no correction must involve the change of nationality, age, status or sex of the petitioner.</li>

	           <p>In case the petitioner has already migrated to another place in the country and it would not be practical for such party, in terms of transportation expenses, time and effort to appear in person before the local civil registrar keeping the documents to be corrected or changed, the petition may be filed, in person, with the local civil registrar of the place where the interested party is presently residing or domiciled. The two (2) local civil registrars concerned will then communicate to facilitate the processing of the petition.</p>

				<li>The new first name or nickname has been habitually and continuously used by the petitioner and he has been publicly known by that by that first name or nickname in the community: or</li>
				<li>The change will avoid confusion.</li>
				</ol>

			<p><strong>SECTION 5.

         <p>Where the petition is denied by the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general, the petitioner may either appeal the decision to the civil registrar general or file the appropriate petition with the proper court.</p>

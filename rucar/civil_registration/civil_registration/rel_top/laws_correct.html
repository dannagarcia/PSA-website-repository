				<h4>Law corrects wrong civil registry entries</h4>

				<p>The tedious and costly procedure in correcting typographical or clerical errors in an entry in the Civil Registry will now be a thing of the past following the passage of Clerical Error Bill which was signed into law recently by President Arroyo.</p>

				<p>Principally authored by Rep. Magtanggol Gunigundo, Republic Act No. 9048 otherwise known as Clerical Error Law was described as a pro-poor piece of legislation which will no longer require the need of a judicial order to correct a typographical error in an entry.</p>

				<p>Gunigundo, in a statement, said he was so elated by its passage "because this will certainly declog court dockets and will give judges and litigators ample time to concentrate in litigating more serious cases."</p>

				<p>"I am proud to have contributed so much to our people for their own welfare," Gunigundo, who is seeking a second term under the banner of the People Power Coalition, said.</p>

				<p>"May this humble contribution be of great help to ease the burden of our people's plight," he said.</p>

				<p>The Gunigundo law was a welcome breather to all citizens who are unduly burdened by the tedious and costly procedure in correcting wrong spelling or any clerical errors from their birth, marriage and death certificates.</p>

				<p>Gunigundo hailed the effort of Senators Loren Legarda and Renato Cayetano for sponsoring a Senate version of the measure.</p>

				<p>He (Gunigundo) was likewise lauded by the officers of an organization called the Civil Registrars of the Philippines for his coming out with such a vital law.</p>

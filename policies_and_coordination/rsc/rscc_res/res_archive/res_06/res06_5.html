						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>,  this Conference adopted the <i>Framework for Action 2005-2015:  Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters</i> acknowledging that efforts to reduce disaster risks must be systematically integrated into policies, plans and programs for sustainable development and poverty reduction;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, the Philippine government through the National Land Use Committee responds to this call by mainstreaming disaster risk management (DRM) in sub-national development and land use planning;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, DRM is defined as a systematic process of using administrative decisions, organization, operational skills and capacities to implement policies, strategies and coping capacities of the society or individuals to lessen the impacts of natural and related environment and technological hazards;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, DRM comprises all forms of activities, including structural and non-structural measures to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) adverse effects of hazards;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, the RSCC is mandated to strengthen statistical coordination at the sub-national level through the institutionalization of appropriate coordination mechanisms that will result in harmonizing statistical operations of data producers for more effective generation of reliable, timely and adequate data;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, DRM is being mainstreamed in the regional plans of various line agencies in the Cordillera Administrative Region such as the member-agencies of the Regional Land Use Committee of the Regional Development Council;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, the adoption of a single guiding principle governing disaster statistics will harmonize the statistical efforts of the RSCC member-agencies;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>WHEREAS</b>, statistical activities include those covered by the Philippine Statistical Development Program, NSCB Resolution No. 1, series of 1992, and pertinent issuances such as Executive Order (EO) 121, s.1987, EO 135, s. 1993, and EO 352, s. 1996.</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT <i>RESOLVED</i> AS IT IS HEREBY <i>RESOLVED</i></b>, that the Regional Statistical Coordination Committee, its member-agencies and all its technical working groups, task forces and other sub-groups, integrate DRM in work programs, statistical activities and statistics related to disasters. </p>
						<p class="align-justify"><b><i>RESOLVED</i> FURTHER</b>, that, in order to enhance the DRM integration process, the RSCC participate in information, education and communication activities on disaster risk management.</p>

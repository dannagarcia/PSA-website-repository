						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, Executive Order 121 mandated the National Statistical Coordination Board to prescribe standard concepts, standards and classifications to ensure harmonization and comparability in the generation of official statistics in the country for national and sub-national development planning among other purposes;</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, highly urbanized cities are separate geopolitical units and independent of their mother provinces and hence, they need separate data to be able to measure and monitor their economic progress and social change;</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, data of highly urbanized cities being generated by some national government agencies are currently aggregated with their mother provinces;</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, as per the Philippine Geographic Classification Code, the city of Baguio is classified as a highly urbanized city;</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, in response to this concern and as part of its commitment to improve the generation of local-level statistics, the NSCB (Board) passed Resolution No. 11, series of 2008 entitled, <i>Enjoining Major Statistical Agencies and Other Data Producers to Generate Separate Data for Highly Urbanized Cities;</i></p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, one of the functions of the RSCC is to oversee the implementation in the region of the policy decisions made by the NSCB;</p>
						<p class="align-justify">NOW, THEREFORE, on motion duly seconded, be </p>
						<p class="align-justify"><i>RESOLVED</i>, AS IT IS HEREBY <i>RESOLVED</i>, that the Committee endorse the NSCB-approved policy of generating separate data for highly urbanized cities for adoption by all concerned government agencies;</p>
						<p class="align-justify"><i>RESOLVED</i>, AS IT IS HEREBY <i>RESOLVED</i>, that this Resolution and NSCB Resolution No. 11, series of 2008 be furnished to all concerned government agencies and local government units for their information and appropriate action;</p>

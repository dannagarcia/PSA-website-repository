							</p>
						</div>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, the Regional Statistical Coordination Committee (RSCC) through NSCB Resolution No. 1 series of 1992 can create task forces to address specific statistical issues;<p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, there is a discrepancy between the number /name of geographic units actually used by LGUs for planning and implementation of programs and projects in the Cordilleras vis-a-vis the official Philippine Standard Geographic Classification (PSGC);</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, the PSGC is a systematic classification and coding of the geographic areas of the country and is based on the four established hierarchical levels of geographical-political subdivisions of the Philippines namely, the administrative region, the province, the municipality/city and the barangay.</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, aside from promoting comparability and uniformity of various statistics on geographic areas, the PSGC serves several other purposes: 1) as a guide in national and local development planning; 2) as an area frame in the conduct of censuses and sample surveys and market studies; 3) a comprehensive list of LGUs in the internal revenue allocation (IRA); 4) as basis in the establishment of precincts/voting centers; 5) establishment of databases; 6) development of geographic information systems and the updating of maps.</p>
						<p class="align-justify">WHEREAS, there is a need to operationalize this endeavor by creating a task force to formulate a work program and undertake the necessary groundwork;</p>
						<p class="align-justify">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED , that the Committee create the "Task Force on Geographic Classification " to undertake the above-mentioned tasks and to be composed of the following :</p>
						<p class="align-justify">
						Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) – Member 
						<br>City Planning and Development Office (CPDO), Baguio City- Member
						<br>Department of Budget and Management (DBM)-Member
						<br>National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) – Member

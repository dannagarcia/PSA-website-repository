      <p align="justify" class="style21 style141 style26 style39">To preserve its cultural uniqueness and to fortify its ethnic solidarity. The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) was carved out of the predominantly Ilocano Regions of Ilocos and Cagayan Valley.&nbsp; Located in the North Central portion of Luzon., the region is composed of six provinces namely Abra, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao, Kalinga and Mountain Province and the chartered city of Baguio.&nbsp; It is further subdivided into 75 municipalities, 2 cities and 1,176 barangays.&nbsp; It is composed of provinces which used to be part of the Old Mountain Province <br>
          <br>
        The region's land area of 1,829,368 hectares accounts for 6.1 percent of the total land mass of the Philippines.&nbsp; As of&nbsp; 2010, the region has a total of 275,769 hectares of Alienable and Disposable Land and 1,553,599 hectares of Total Forest Land <br>
        <br>
        Dubbed as the "Watershed Cradle of the Philippines", the Cordillera has a mountainous topography characterized by towering peaks, plateaus and intermittent patches of valleys. Almost 71 percent of the region's land area has slopes of 30 percent and above. <br>
        <br>
        Cordillera is endowed with the abundant mineral reserves.&nbsp; These are metallic ores such as gold copper, silver, zinc, and non-metallic minerals like sand, gravel and sulfur.&nbsp; Mineral reserves are found in Abra, Benguet, Kalinga, Apayao and Mt. Province.&nbsp; <span class="style46">However, mining operations are still concentrated in Benguet where almost 100 percent of the region's mineral production in 2009 was registered. </span><br>
        <br>
        The region is the least populated region in the country despite its vast land area.&nbsp; The total population in August 2000 is 1,365,412 and grew to 1,616,867 in May 2010 reflecting 1.73 growth rate from 1990 to 2010.&nbsp; Agriculture remains to be  the primary preoccupation which employs more than half of the regions workforce. &nbsp; Industry, which accounts for 60.8 percent of the region's total economy, registered a single-digit growth of 2.1 percent. With this, the overall economy of CAR managed to grow by 2.0 percent in 2009. <br>

      <p>Located at the southern end of the Cordillera Region is the province of Benguet. Bounded on the south by Pangasinan and on the west by La Union and Ilocos Sur, Benguet serves as the gateway to the highland provinces of the Cordillera Region. <br><br>

      At 5,000 feet above sea level, the province lies on top of the Cordillera Mountains. Rugged and sloping terrain and deep valleys characterize the province. Amidst these mountain peaks is a wide plateau wherein the capital town, La Trinidad, is located. A total of 13 municipalities and 140 barangays make up the province. <br>
      <br>
      As of 2010, Benguet has a total land area of 2,833.0 square kilometers with most of it falling within the Cordillera Forest Reserve. Forest land totals 214,523 hectares with forest land comprising 0f 105,626 hectares as of May 2007. <br>
      <br>
      In the sparsely populated Cordillera Region, as of May 2010 Benguet stands out as having the biggest population among the provinces and city with 403,494. However, it is next to Baguio City for its population density of 142.4 persons per square kilometer. Migrants have joined the local tribes such as the Kankana-ey, Ibaloy and Kalanguya to settle in this rich highland province. Although the three tribes speak different dialects, they share similar cultures and have common beliefs and rituals. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a name="economy"></a>
      <strong>The Economy</strong><br>
      <br>
      Nature has endowed Benguet with immense riches. Vast tracts of timberland, mineral deposits and fertile soil abound in Benguet. Its unique sub-tropical climate alone is a distinctive asset. The pineclad mountains and cool weather is a veritable paradise for those weary of the tropical heat. <br>
      <br>
      Agriculture has been the traditional source of employment for most of the people in Benguet. Vegetable farming, cattle raising, poultry and flower-raising, provide employment for the province and its neighboring provinces. Benguet is popularly known as the "Salad Bowl" of the Philippines because virtually every type of vegetable used in salads is produced here. But of late, the title "Strawberry Country" has been added. Various species of luscious strawberries, a rarity in the tropics, are now being raised in Benguet. While the province is a leading producer of Baguio vegetables, it also has potential for growing oranges, pears and other temperate fruits. <br>
      <br>
      Beneath the mountains of Benguet lies treasures of gold, copper, limestone and pyrite. Approximately 6,227,565 metric tons of primary gold ore and 897,551,435 metrioc tons of primary copper are in Benguet. The discovery of gold in the province led to the goldrush in the 1930's and the birth of the mining communities. Today, three large mining companies, Benguet Corporation, Philex Mining and Lepanto Mining Corporation are operating in Benguet. The mining firms contribute to about 98% of the province's export revenue. <br>
      <br>
      Added to the mining and vegetable farming, manufacturing is likewise a major economic activity in the province. Loom weaving which is a traditional art has been transformed into a major industry and ranks as one of the top exports of the province. <br>
      <br>
      Knitting, fruit processing, bamboo craft, metal craft, wood carving, and tigergrass craft are just some of the industries currently found in Benguet. However, based on resources, the province holds great potentials for ore processing, silk fibercraft, rootcraft processing, mushroom processing and strawberry processing. <br>
      <br>
      Like the rest of the Cordillera provinces, Benguet is the major tourist destination in the Philippines. Its picturesque landscape, unique culture, warm people and temperate climate all contribute to it being a favorite among the tourists. As such, tourists-related industries such as handicrafts, restaurants and inns have been very viable enterprises. Among the 26 tourist spots that are must see for the tourists are the Kabayan Mummies; Ambuklao and Binga Dams, the major sources of hydro power in Luzon; La Trinidad Valley; Timbac Caves; and, Mt. Pulag, the second highest mountain in the country. Various hot springs, water falls and caves are just some of the natural wonders that continue to attract visitors to the area. <br>
      <br>
      Benguet is also the site of many events in our country's history. The tunnels at Tadiangan built by the Japanese during World War II, the Kaliwaga Cave in Kapungan used as Burial caves in the 15th century, the guerrilla Saddle at Halsema Road which was the battleground of the famous 66th Infantry Battalion and Guerrillas who fought the Japanese Imperial Army and Camp Utopia where Majors Bado Dangwa and Dennis Molintas led the defense of Igorotlandia, are just some of the historical sites found in Benguet. <br>
      <br>
      With these natural resources and its proximity to Baguio City and the lowland provinces, Benguet has great potentials for economic growth. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <a name="history"></a>      
      <strong>Brief History </strong><br>
      <br>
      Early in the 19th century after the Spanish explorer Guillermo Galley's report of his expedition, the Spanish Government organized the mountain region into six (6) commandancias politico-militar namely: Benguet in 1846, Lepanto in 1852, Bonico in 1859, Amburayan in 1889, and Kayapa and Kabugao in 1891. The province of Benguet, as now constituted, have portion of which were parts of the Districts of Lepanto, Bonico and Amburayan.</p>
      <p> Early commandancias were divided into rancherias. The commandancia of Benguet was consisted of 41 rancherias with La Trinidad, named after Galley's wife, as capital. <br>
      <br>
      In 1899, the Katipunan came to Benguet and united the Igorots and established Benguet under the Government of the Republic of the Philippines. Ora Juan Cari&ntilde;o of Tublay was appointed Governor of Benguet and Chairman of the Board. In La Trinidad, Miguel Picarte was appointed as president but their terms were short lived for the American colonizers came in the early 1900's. <br>
      <br>
      Under the American rule, civil government was established under Act No. 48 in the following township of Benguet: Adaoay, Ambuklao, Ampusongan, Atok, Balakbak, Bokod, Buguias, Kabayan, Kibungan, Daclan, Gallano, Itogon, Palina, Sablan and Tublay. The government of each township was vested in the president and a council composed of one representative from each barrio of the township. When Act No. 1876 was passed in August 13. 1908, Benguet province became a sub-province of the Mountain Province. Under this Act, the sub-province embraced by the Mountain Provinces were Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Bontoc, Ifugao, Kalinga and Lepanto. <br>
      <br>
      The original 19 township of Benguet as embodied in Act No. 48 dated November 22, 1900 were reduced to 13 municipalities. The township of Baguio became a chartered city on September 1, 1909, creating in its place the township of Tuba. The township of Ambuklao, Adaoay, Balakbak, Galiano, Palina and Loo were abolished under Executive Orders issued by the Governor of the Philippines. <br>
      <br>
      Today, the province of Benguet still holds claim as the "Salad Bowl of the Philippines" because of its considerable production of upland vegetables. </p>

                                    <p>The total population of Ifugao as of May 2010 was 191,078 and a growth rate of 1.31 from 1990 to 2010. </p>
                                    <p>As of 2010, Ifugao's total land area is 2,506.3 square kilometers. A total of 27,083 hectares are classified as alienable and disposable, and 224,695 hectares are forest land. </p>

                                  
                                    <p><strong>Brief History </strong></p> 
                                    <p>The province of Ifugao derives it name from the word &quot;Pugo&quot; which means hills in the native language. Despite the influence of Christianity, age-old traditions are alive and are still practiced. For instance, during harvest time, Ifugaos still celebrate with a &quot;caniao&quot; where sacrificial animals such as chickens, pigs and even carabaos are butchered. Ifugao culture is some 3,000 years old. </p>
                                    <p>During their brief occupation of the province, the Spaniards established &quot;pueblos&quot; (towns) headed by the &quot;Alcalde Municipal&quot; and barangays (barrios) headed by the &quot;Cabeza de Barangay&quot;. The Spaniards largely confined their activities within Kiangan, Ifugao. Spanish rule ended with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. </p>
                                    <p>In 1905, Ifugao was made a sub-province of the Old Mountain Province. The sub-province of was administered by a Lt. Governor Hon. Luis Pawid of Kiangan became the first Deputy Governor during the American regime. Captain Pedro Bulan was the last official to assume the office of Deputy Governor. </p>
                                    <p>Ifugao became the center of warfare during the last stages of the World War II. It was in Mt. Napulawan in Ifugao where Gen. Yamashita, the &quot;Tiger of Malaya&quot; put up his last stand against the Filipino and American forces. He initially surrendered to Capt. Grisham of the US Army based in Kiangan before he was flown to Camp John Hay, Baguio City where he formally surrendered. </p>
                                    <p>At the start of World War II, there were five (5) minicipalities namely: Burnay (later changed to Lagawe by virtue of Republic Act 3380), Kiangan, Banaue, Hungduan and Mayoyao. Them municipalities of Potia, now Alfonso Lista, and Lamut were created after the war. Asipulo was created in 1992 and is the youngest municipality of the province. </p>
                                    <p>Ifugao gained provincial status on June 18, 1966 by virtue of Republic Act 4695 with the municipality of Lagawe as the capital town. Currently, in addition to the capital, the other municipalities are as follows: Asipulo, Aguinaldo, Alfonso Lista, Banaue, Hingyon, Hungduan, Kiangan, Lamut, Mayoyao and Tinoc. </p>

                                    <p>The existing tourist attractions in the province are classified under four categories namely man-made, historical, cultural, and natural spots. Dubbed as the &quot;8th Wonder of the World&quot; is the Banaue Rice Terraces which is the most well known of Ifugao's terraces. Among the other popular terraces in the province are the Bangaan, Batad, Mayoyao and Hapao rice terraces. Magat Dam, the biggest dam in Asia, in the municipality of Alfonso Lista is also an added man-made attraction in the province. </p>

      <p><strong>Brief History </strong><br> <br>
        During the Spanish Era.&nbsp; Benguet was not a remote area for the Spaniards to explore.&nbsp; The vastness and promising economic potential of the place lured the Spaniards to conduct a series of expeditions. &nbsp; Series of attempts to pacify the "Igorots" but failed.&nbsp; Finally in 1846, Commandante de Galvey established his Commandancia at La Trinidad, Benguet (named after his wife).&nbsp; The first Kapitan of Benguet was Pulito of Kafagway, now Baguio, a minor rancheria of about 20 houses.</p>
      
      <p>The Spaniards were able to establish order, build churches and schools, made trails and introduce coffle during their long occupation of the area. </p>
      
      <p>The Americans came early in 1900 and established their government with H. Whitmarsh as the appointed Governor of Benguet and Baguio City as the capital.&nbsp; This was the first provincial government to be established in the Philippines and this happened a year prior to the inauguration of the civil government of the Philippines.&nbsp; Their best administrators and teachers were fervent boosters and promoters: Worcester, Wright Forbes, Pack Barrows, Eckman and others who together with Filipinos committed to make the place a haven. </p>
      <p>The mines near Baguio were developed and became productive.&nbsp; Business in the city flourished with commercial centers put up. &nbsp; Recreational facilities were installed.&nbsp; The city was growing before the outbreak of the war. </p>
      <p>Baguio was bombed December 8, 1941 by the Japanese and they occupied it on December 27 of the same year. However, the war changed course and on September 3, 1945, General Yamashita surrendered to the Americans at the US Ambassador's residence in Camp John Hay, after which, Baguio immediately set to the task of rehabilitation. </p>
      <p>The July 16, 1990 earthquake devastated the entire city with its infrastructures, buildings and its populace. Four years after the great earthquake, Baguio City has recovered and is standing firm and proud for its restored heritage.

                                      <p>The word "Banaue" is derived from the word "Banawor," a swift flying bird at night that lived in one of the oldest sitios of the town. In time, the whole town came to be referred to as Banaue. when the Spaniards occupied the town, they mispronounced Banawor as Banaue and the error stuck.</p>

                                      <p>The origin of the people of Banaue is believed to be from a single migrating people who carried the rice terracing culture from South China and Indo-China across Luzon and Southern Japan and southward to Java and the lesser Sunda Islands. Artifact remains indicate that the first migration was probably in the second millennium before Christ and carried only material culture of polish stones, coppers, and bronze. It was believed too that the second millennium brought with them the use of iron, pottery and woven cloth. As a result, the people learned how to carve figurines, a skill that later on made the municipality known for its wood carving industry.</p>

                                      <p>The inhabitants of Banaue are bound by a common origin, language, culture, mores, customs and traditions. Because of this and the need to survive, they were able to carve from mountains the famous rice terraces now known as the "8th Wonder of the World."</p>

                                      <p>During the Spanish Regime, the government in Banaue was not fully established. The Spaniards tried to establish garrison at Ducligan, which became the seat of the Spanish Government, but this did not last long because of the hostility of the peoples, for which reason they left the garrison and went to Mayoyao.</p>

                                      <p>In 1901, the American Government was established in Banaue headed by Capt. Jeff Gelman of the American ARmy who was appointed as its lieutenant governor. CAptain Gelman was succeeded by Col. William Dosser who served as the last American governor of Ifugao. His deputy provincial governor and Philippine Constabulary provincial commander was Captain Bulan of Solano, Cagayan.</p>

                                      <p>On June 25, 1963, under Executive Order No. 42, banaue together with Mayoyao, Lamut and Kiangan, became a regular municipality. Banaue is politically subdivided into 18 barangays, namely: Amganad, Anaba, Balawis, Banao, Bangaan, Batad, Bocos, Cambulo, Ducligan, Gohang, Kinakin, Poblacion, Poitan, Pula, San Fernando, Tam-an, Viewpoint and Uhaj.</p>

Amuyao, the highest peak in the area and is bound on the north by Mt. Province, on the south by the Municipality of Hingyon and on the east by the municipality of Hungduan. It is 25 kilometers west of Lagawe, the capital town of Ifugao.</p>

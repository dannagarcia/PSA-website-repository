                                    <p>As of 2010, Ifugao's total land area is 2,506.3 square kilometers. A total of 27,083 hectares are classified as alienable and disposable, and 224,695 hectares are forest land. </p>

                                  
                                    <p><strong>Brief History </strong></p> 
                                    <p>The province of Ifugao derives it name from the word &quot;Pugo&quot; which means hills in the native language. Despite the influence of Christianity, age-old traditions are alive and are still practiced. For instance, during harvest time, Ifugaos still celebrate with a &quot;caniao&quot; where sacrificial animals such as chickens, pigs and even carabaos are butchered. Ifugao culture is some 3,000 years old. </p>
                                    <p>During their brief occupation of the province, the Spaniards established &quot;pueblos&quot; (towns) headed by the &quot;Alcalde Municipal&quot; and barangays (barrios) headed by the &quot;Cabeza de Barangay&quot;. The Spaniards largely confined their activities within Kiangan, Ifugao. Spanish rule ended with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. </p>
                                    <p>In 1905, Ifugao was made a sub-province of the Old Mountain Province. The sub-province of was administered by a Lt. Governor Hon. Luis Pawid of Kiangan became the first Deputy Governor during the American regime. Captain Pedro Bulan was the last official to assume the office of Deputy Governor. </p>
                                    <p>Ifugao became the center of warfare during the last stages of the World War II. It was in Mt. Napulawan in Ifugao where Gen. Yamashita, the &quot;Tiger of Malaya&quot; put up his last stand against the Filipino and American forces. He initially surrendered to Capt. Grisham of the US Army based in Kiangan before he was flown to Camp John Hay, Baguio City where he formally surrendered. </p>
                                    <p>At the start of World War II, there were five (5) minicipalities namely: Burnay (later changed to Lagawe by virtue of Republic Act 3380), Kiangan, Banaue, Hungduan and Mayoyao. Them municipalities of Potia, now Alfonso Lista, and Lamut were created after the war. Asipulo was created in 1992 and is the youngest municipality of the province. </p>
                                    <p>Ifugao gained provincial status on June 18, 1966 by virtue of Republic Act 4695 with the municipality of Lagawe as the capital town. Currently, in addition to the capital, the other municipalities are as follows: Asipulo, Aguinaldo, Alfonso Lista, Banaue, Hingyon, Hungduan, Kiangan, Lamut, Mayoyao and Tinoc. </p>

                                    <p>The existing tourist attractions in the province are classified under four categories namely man-made, historical, cultural, and natural spots. Dubbed as the &quot;8th Wonder of the World&quot; is the Banaue Rice Terraces which is the most well known of Ifugao's terraces. Among the other popular terraces in the province are the Bangaan, Batad, Mayoyao and Hapao rice terraces.

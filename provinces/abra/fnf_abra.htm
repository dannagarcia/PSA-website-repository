It is bounded on the north by Ilocos Norte and the south by Ilocos Sur and Mountain Province. Towards the east is Kalinga and on the west, the province of Apayao. As it straddles the Ilocandia and the Cordillera, these landlocked province is a melting pot of the lowland people of dominant Spanish ancestry and the unique ethnicity of the upland Tingguian tribe. <br>
                                Insulated by the Mountainous Gazebo, nature has remained prestine in Abra and life goes on in a relaxed pace away from the humdrum of urban cosmopolitan living.

In the year 2010 it has the largest area of alienable and disposable land totalling 89,034 hectares, more than one-fourth of the region's A &amp; D lands.

                                <p><strong>Brief History </strong><br><br>
                                Abra was created a politico-militar province in 1846, prior to which it comprised part of the old Ilocos Province and later to Ilocos Sur when Ilocos was divided into two provinces in 1818.Civil Government was established in Abra on August 19,1901, but on February 1905 it was re-annexed to Ilocos Sur. Abra remained a sub-province for 12 years regaining its status as a province only after the passage of Act 2683 in March 1977. </p>
                                <p>Records show that even before the Spanish conquest of the country, the people of Abra were already engaged in agriculture, production and trade. The Abra River was the primary means of transportation in and out of Abra. Traders from Vigan and other provinces used the river in bringing their trade to the provinces. The horse, for which Abra was once famous, was also used as a means of transportation especially for the people coming from the mountains until the Tangadan tunnel was built in San Quintin.</p>
                                <p>Te cultural heritage of the province is clearly manifested by the customs of the people, especially those from the mountain areas. The presense of antique porcelain jars and gongs indicate that the people of Abra were once engaged in trade either directly or indirectly with the other oriental countries most probably China. This is also substantiated by the kind of music that the people in the highland play during special occasions and celebrations. Such practices as the &quot;kalon&quot; which is a type of compact or treaty practice by the highlanders is believed to have started before Magellan came to the Philippines. </p>
                                <p>When the Spaniards came to the country, missionary work was done in Abra particularly by the Augustinian friars who founded the town of Bangued in 1898. They also made extensive studies on the culture of the mountain people of the province.</p>
                                <p>With the revolutionary movement which started in the eighteenth century, the people of Abra actively participated in the national uprising. In the middle part of 1899, 1 revolutionary government was set up in Abra through the leadership of Don Blas Villamor. Leocadio Valera became provincial governor until Abra fell into the hands of the American forces. The Americans established a civil government on August 19, 1901.</p>
                                <p>During the World War II, when the Philippines fell under the Japanese Imperial Army, a sudversive guerilla organization was formed to resist the Japanese Occupation Army. The Japanese Occupation which lasted from April 1942 to April 1945 adversely affected the industries and proprties of the people. The province recovered only after the Philippines was liberated by the American forces in the latter part of 1945. The coming of the Americans brought about substantial change in the social, religious and political life of the province.</p>

                                <p>Abra is composed of 27 municipalities and 303 barangays. The capital town is Bangued while the other municipalities are Boliney, Bucay, Bucloc, Daguioman, Danglas, Dolores, Lacub, Lagangilang, Lagayan, Langiden, La Paz, Licuan-Baay, Luba, Malibcong, Manabo, Penarrubia, Pidigan, Pilar, Sallapadan, San Isidro, San Juan, San Quintin, Tayum, Tineg, Tubo and Villaviciosa.</p>

                                  <p>Kalinga is a landlocked province in the northernmost section of the Cordillera Region. It is bounded by the provinces of Cagayan and Apayao in the north, Mt. Province in the south, and Abra in the West. The greater sections of Cagayan and Isabela are found on its eastern part. </p>
                                  <p>Sharp-crested interlinking mountain peaks, steep slopes, isolated flat lands, plateau's and valley characterize the western side while the eastern section is generally rolling with gradually sloping foothills, interlocking wide track of flat lands and floodplains along its main rivers. Among land and waterforms which constitute potential tourism sights are its waterfalls, hot springs, rice terraces and subterranean rivers. </p>
                                  <p>Composed of seven municipalities and one component city, the province's land area as of 2010 is 3,164.3 square kilometers occupying 17% of the Cordillera Administrative Region's land area. </p>
                                  <p>A sizeable 85.96% of the total land area has been declared under the Revised Forestry Code inalienable and disposable or public land leaving only 14.04% as alienable disposable. This can be counted as a major issue aside from the inaccessibilty attributed by the terrain of the province. </p>
                                  <p>Under the national population count conducted by the National Statistics Office (NSO), as of May 2010, Kalinga registered a total population of 201,613 and a growth rate of 1.95 from 1990 to 2010. The City of Tabuk has the highest population count  103,912 persons. This is because Tabuk City is the capital of the province and is the center of commerce, trade and industry making the city an immigration area. The least populated town is Tanudan with only 8,119 populatioln count. </p>
                                  <p>The province is richly endowed with mineral resources, both metallic and non-metallic which are said to be mostly found in the municipalities of Balbalan and Pasil. There are also evidences on the presence of non-metallic reserves such as sulphur, gravel and sand.</p>

                                  <p><strong>Brief History </strong><br>
                                  <br>
                                  The name Kalinga is derived from the Ibanag and Gaddang "Kalinga" which means "headhunters.&quot; In the past, headhunting was considered noble and it symbolizes bravery. Tatoos, a status symbol which men respect and which women admire, are given to warriors as reward. Thus a "mingol" or warrior enjoys a high status in Kalinga society. </p>
                                  <p>The "Bodong" to the Kalingas or peace pact is an indigenous socio-political system that defines intertribal relationships. This was developed to minimize traditional warfare and headhunting and serves as an institution for renewal, maintenance and reinforcement of social ties. Recently, the "bodong" was expanded into a multi-lateral peace pact providing a means of strengthening unity in the Cordilleras. </p>
                                  <p>The Spanish missionaries and politico-military forces successfully penetrated into the forbidding Apayaos and Kalinga tribal territories as early as 1608 when Father Geronimo Molina started his mission work in Pudtol (Apayao) and also in 1689 at Tuga (Kalinga) where the first Catholic Mass was celebrated. </p>
                                  <p>During the short-lived Philippine Republic, President Emilio Aguinaldo in his flight to Palanan crossed the upper Kalinga areas in his vain attempt to elude his American pursuers. For 35 days, President Aguinaldo established his headquarters at Lubuagan since March 18,1900. Here, he issued his orders to his military generals and the civil officials of his revolutionary government until he was forced out of Lubuagan upon learning that his pursuers were sighted at Mabongtoto. This prompted him to escape towards Tabuk in that historic last leg of his fight to Palanan, Isabela where he was later captured. </p>
                                  <p>On February 4, 1920, Act No. 2772 was promulgated reorganizing the Lepanto-Bontoc Province into Mountain Province constituted by the five provinces of Benguet, Bonito, Ifugao, Kalinga-Apayao. Lubuagan was the capital of Kalinga while Kabugao was the capital town of Apayao. </p>
                                  <p>On June 18, 1966, Republic Act No. 4695 was enacted creating from the old Mountain Province five separate and independent provinces: Benguet, Ifugao, Mt. Province (Bonito) and Kalinga-Apayao. On March 26, 1967, President Ferdinand E. Marcos administered the oath of office to the new officials of the four newly born provinces. </p>
                                  <p>Presently, Kalinga is fast emerging as an "Eco-Tourism Discovery of the Cordilleras" since its operation as a regular and separate province on February 14, 1996. </p>

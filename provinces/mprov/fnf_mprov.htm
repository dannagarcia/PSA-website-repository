                                    <p>Baguio City, approximately 250 kilometers north of Manila, is situated in the Province of Benguet. &nbsp; The area of the city is 57.5 square kilometers enclosed in perimeter of 30.6 kilometers. The developed portion of the city corresponds to a plateau that rises to an elevation of 1,400 meters.&nbsp; Most of it lies in the northern half of the city. </p>

                                    <p>There are two great valleys found in the south and the north of the city.&nbsp; The more famous Guisad-Lucban Valley has an elevation that ranges from 1,300 to 1,400 meters and is centrally located towards the north.&nbsp; The southern valley is composed of long and narrow vales surround by low hills transected by a network of hills.&nbsp; Some of the more important valleys are Camp 7, Loakan, Bakakeng and Crystal Cave. These valleys are arable and rich in alluvial deposits. </p>

                                    <p>The summits of the plateau offer panoramic views.&nbsp; The summit that face the west: Quezon Hill, Mirador Dominican Hill and The Bureau of Animal Industries S.tock Farm offers splendid view of the Locos Coastal Plain, Lingayen Gulf and the South China Sea during cloudless days. </p>

                                    <p>Another famous promontory is Mines View Park which overlooks the mining town of Itogon and offers a glimpse of the Amburayan Valley.&nbsp; All over the city, however, are sporadically scattered steep side hills and mountains.&nbsp; About half the area of the City has a slope of 25 degrees or above.</p>

                                    <p>The total population of Baguio City as of May 2010 is 318,676 and have growth rate of 2.81 from 1990 to 2010.</p> 

                                    <p><strong>Brief History </strong><br> <br>
                                    During the Spanish Era.&nbsp; Benguet was not a remote area for the Spaniards to explore.&nbsp; The vastness and promising economic potential of the place lured the Spaniards to conduct a series of expeditions. &nbsp; Series of attempts to pacify the "Igorots" but failed.&nbsp; Finally in 1846, Commandante de Galvey established his Commandancia at La Trinidad, Benguet (named after his wife).&nbsp; The first Kapitan of Benguet was Pulito of Kafagway, now Baguio, a minor rancheria of about 20 houses.</p>

                                    <p>The Spaniards were able to establish order, build churches and schools, made trails and introduce coffle during their long occupation of the area. </p>

                                    <p>The Americans came early in 1900 and established their government with H. Whitmarsh as the appointed Governor of Benguet and Baguio City as the capital.&nbsp; This was the first provincial government to be established in the Philippines and this happened a year prior to the inauguration of the civil government of the Philippines.&nbsp; Their best administrators and teachers were fervent boosters and promoters: Worcester, Wright Forbes, Pack Barrows, Eckman and others who together with Filipinos committed to make the place a haven. </p>
                                    <p>The mines near Baguio were developed and became productive.&nbsp; Business in the city flourished with commercial centers put up. &nbsp; Recreational facilities were installed.&nbsp; The city was growing before the outbreak of the war. </p>
                                    <p>Baguio was bombed December 8, 1941 by the Japanese and they occupied it on December 27 of the same year. However, the war changed course and on September 3, 1945, General Yamashita surrendered to the Americans at the US Ambassador's residence in Camp John Hay, after which, Baguio immediately set to the task of rehabilitation. </p>
                                    <p>The July 16, 1990 earthquake devastated the entire city with its infrastructures, buildings and its populace. Four years after the great earthquake, Baguio City has recovered and is standing firm and proud for its restored heritage.

      <p>Formerly dubbed as " La Montanosa"&nbsp; by Spanish administrators for its mountainous terrain, Mt. Province lies in the heart of the Grand Cordillera, known to be the Philippine's biggest and highest chain of mountains. The province is bounded on the North by Kalinga, on the south by Benguet and Ifugao, on the east by Isabela, and on the west by Ilocos Sur and Abra. </p>
      <p>Mt. Province's total land area is 2,239.9 square kilometers, 23% of which are classified as alienable and disposable, and 77% as forest lands. Towering peaks and sharp ridges describe the central and western parts of the province, while gradually sloping and rolling foothills are the general features of the eastern towns. <br>
          <br>
      Mt. Province is geo-politically subdivided into 10 municipalities and 144 barangays. As of May 2010, the total population of Mt. Province is 153,187 and a growth rate of 1.41 from 1990 to 2010. Agriculture is the main source of income with tourism providing a significant boost to its economy. <br>
      <br>
      Although Bontoc is the province's capital,&nbsp; the town of Sagada is more famous among tourists. Its rice terraces, though lesser known&nbsp; compared to the Banaue rice terraces, are equally spectacular. Whereas the walls of the Banaue's terraces are of compacted earth, Sagada's walls are small rocks laboriously piled one on top of the other. The town is also known for its limestone caves that served as burial grounds during the pre-Christian Sagada era.

      <strong>Brief History </strong><br>
      <br>
      Mountain Province became a special province of the Philippines in 1907. It was made up of the sub-provinces of Bontoc-Lepanto, Amburayan, Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao and Kalinga. The provincial supervisor was appointed governor of the province and Bontoc was then the capital town. <br>
      <br>
      Mountain Province became an independent province on March 25, 1967 when President Ferdinand E. Marcos officially appointed and inducted into office the first set of provincial officials. On April 7, 1967, the new Mountain Province came into operation. This date was unanimously adopted by the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on their regular meeting held on June 10, 1980 as the Mountain Province Day. </p>
      <p>To date, Mt. Province is growing in popularity as a "Spelunkers Delight and Weavers Paradise. " It is becoming a favorite destination of both local and foreign visitors. <br>

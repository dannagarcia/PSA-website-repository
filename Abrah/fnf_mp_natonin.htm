      <p align="justify" class="style44"><strong>History and Government </strong></p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">During the early part of the American regime, a military expedition was sent to pioneer and establish a local government unit in the eastern part of Mountain Province . In the past, communities existing in this area were named by the inhabitants by purok. The American soldiers who were sent to consolidate the different puroks into districts had to give a name for the locality. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The usual practice of the people in the area was to eat cold rice cooked the previous evening. One morning, a soldier passed by the place and asked for the name of the place. As a gesture of hospitality, the resident who answered &ldquo;natomnin&rdquo;, meaning, &ldquo;Come! Let us have a breakfast of cold rice.&quot; The soldier thought that was the answer to his question and immediately jotted the word &ldquo;Natonin&rdquo; with a slight correction - removing the letter &ldquo;m&rdquo; for better pronunciation. Thereafter, &ldquo;Natonin&rdquo; was registered as the official name of the newly established municipal district. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The Philippine Constabulary Barracks Reservation was established here and where the first set of officers held their office. Madoli Gagen was appointed as the first president of the newly established municipality. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">Natonin has eleven barangays, namely: Alunogan, Balangao, Banao, Banawel, Butac, Maducayan, Poblacion, Pudo, Saliok, Sta. Isabel and Tonglayan. Pudo was a part of Alunogan until lately when it became a regular barangay. Poblacion is the site where most of the basic and social services, including the municipal hall, are found and where most of the economic activities are centered. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style50">Its Land </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">Natonin is a landlocked municipality with a total land area of 49,050 hectares and located about 90 kilometres east of Bontoc, the capital town of Mountain Province and about 60 kilometres from Santiago City, Isabela. It is situated 121&deg; 16.5&rdquo; longitude and 17&deg; 6.6&rdquo; latitude. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The municipality is bounded on the north by the province of Kalinga, on the south by the province of Ifugao, on the east by the municipality of Paracelis, and on the west by the municipality of Barlig. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The topography is mountainous with thick woodland forests characterized by gradually sloping areas with some low hill areas. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The existing percentage distribution of land use in the municipality is as follows: built-up area 9,810 hectares or 20%; agricultural 14,715 hectares or 30%; grass/shrublands 4,905 hectares or 10%; woodland/forest 18,884 hectares or 39.50% and others are 736 hectares or 1.5%. Agricultural lands which comprise 14,715 hectares are mostly found on the mountain slopes usually terraced and irrigated. Woodlands or forests cover the biggest area encompassing 18,884 hectares of the total municipal area. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="justify" class="style50">Its Inhabitants </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The people of Natonin are from two distinct ethnic groups. Most of the inhabitants are of Igorot stock. The Madukayyong tribe identifies itself as Igorot, in that they are geographically in Igorot territory, yet many of their traditions and dialects are more closely related to Kalingan. It could be argued that the Madukayyong are the southernmost Kalingan tribe. Head hunting was practiced in Maducayan as late as the mid-1930s, and was set aside in favor of Christianity and education after World War II. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The latest total population recorded by the National Statistics Office is 10,048 (May 2010). Its total number of households is 1,768 with an average household size of 5. </p>

      <p align="justify" class="style50">Its Economy </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">The municipality of Natonin is basically an agricultural area where farming is the primary source of livelihood. It has a total land area of 49,050 hectares of which 14,715 hectares or 30 percent are devoted to agriculture. The farmer&rsquo;s main crop is rice. The rice terraces which are carved from the mountain slopes are planted and harvested twice while upland rice planted in kaingins are planted once. Other crops of the municipality include corn, vegetables, peanuts, root crops, and fruits. Wild coffee beans are harvested from the forest. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">Agricultural production in the area is potentially high. However, due to crude agricultural practices, inadequacy of irrigation facilities and farm-to-market roads and technical assistance, production is not maximized. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">As to livestock production, the municipality has no operational piggery or poultry farms. There is backyard raising of chickens, pigs, ducks and a number of family ponds for raising tilapia but solely for household consumption. Cattle and and meat production are also on a limited scale. Hence, the municipality occasionally suffers from a shortage of pork and meat supply</p>

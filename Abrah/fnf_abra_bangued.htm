          The name Bangued was an evolution of the word &quot;bangan&quot; meaning roadblocks or blockades. The municipality was also referred to and called by the name &ldquo;Banged&rdquo; especially by the old inhabitants outside of the municipality.<br><br>In 1615, Father Juan Pareja organized Bangued as a mission center and baptized 3,000 Tingguians with the help of Don Manuel Domaoal who was their chief. In 1692, Bangued was made an independent mission territory by the Augustinians under Father Columbo. The modern-day Bangued was formally organized in 1704, and was made the capital town of Abra in 1863. Before the World War II, the town of Bangued was once a sprawling community of several sitios until it was razed to the ground during the March 10, 1945 massive bombing by the Allied Forces.<br>During the Spanish regime, the early local officials of Bangued were Don Eulalio Villamor, Don Juan Paredes and Don Juan Valera. During the American Regime, the Alcaldes Mayores were Don Lucas Ferraren, Don Juan Ferraren, Don Mariano Baula, Don Santos Valera, Dr. Maximo Blanco, Don Esteban Valera, Don Longino Bersamin and Don Anselmo Bringas. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1938, the mayor was Don Longino Bersamin who continued to be mayor until 1946. The administration of Don Bersamin was cut short when Agapito Gardoque became mayor during the Japanese Occupation. <br>
          Bangued has 31 barangays: Agtangao, Angad, Banacao, Bangbangar, Cabuloan, Calaba, Calot/Tablac, Cosili West, Cosili East, Dangdangla, Lingtan, Lipcan, Lubong, Macarcarmay, Macray, Maoay, Malita, Palao, Patucannay, Sagap, San Antonio, Santa Rosa, Sao-atan, Sappaac, Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Zone 5, Zone 6 and Zone 7.

        <p ><strong>Its Land</strong></p>
        <p >Bangued is located at the western portion of the province of Abra, about 408 kilometers north of Manila. North of Bangued are the municipalities of Danglas and La Paz, on the east are the municipalities of Tayum and Pe&ntilde;arrubia, on the west by the municipality of Langiden and the province of Ilocos Norte and on the south by the municipalities of San Isidro and Pidigan.<br>
        <br>
        Bangued is generally mountainous at the northern and southern portions with elevations ranging from 60 to 1,000 meters above sea level. Slope inclination of hills and mountains in the northern side is 30% while the southern portion is 15% inclination. The mid-section of the municipality is predominantly flat and rolling with an average elevation of 45 meters above sea level.<br>
        <br>
        The prevailing climate is characterized by two pronounced seasons, dry from October to April and wet during the remaining months. The peak of annual mean rainfall occurs within the month of August at 680 mm. from an average of 274 mm. during the remaining months. Typhoons, which usually occur during the month of August, regularly pass through the municipality causing the relatively high mean rainfall.<br>
        <br>
        With Bangued's total land area of 10,570 hectares or about 2.66% of the total provincial land area, 86.7% of which is classified as alienable and disposable with the remaining 13.3% is classified under other categories. The area of forest land is 1,405.5 hectares. Total forested area is 384.5 hectares of which 57 hectares are declared as forest reserve/national parks.<br>
        <br>
        The municipality has 2 major rivers, the Sinalang and Abra Rivers. These bodies of water provide for the fish supply of the municipality complemented by privately-owned fish ponds and irrigated rice fields used as fish ponds.<br>
        <br>
        Metal minerals are not present in the municipality. However, there is an abundance of limestone deposits in different locations. Gravel and sand are also available along the banks of the Abra River.<br>
        
        <br>
          <strong>Its Inhabitants <a name="inhabitants"></a>  </strong></p>
          <p >The early settlers were the Tingguians belonging to the Bago, Itneg, Masadiit, lbanao, and Indayas tribes, who later intermarried with the immigrants from Ilocos Sur. The Tingguians opposed the Christianization introduced by the Spanish friars who penetrated the eastern settlements. </p>
          <p >The current inhabitants of Bangued are predominantly Ilocano. In 2007, total population was recorded at 46,179 and decreased to 43,936 in 2010. Population density in 2010 is 416 persons per square kilometer.<br>
      
          <p ><strong>Its Economy<a name="economy"></a></strong></p>
          <p >The economy of the municipality is heavily dependent on agriculture particularly palay and corn, followed by trade and industry. Chinese businessmen dominate trade and manufacturing as a common preoccupation of the populace.</p>
          <p >The commercial activity of Bangued is confined within the urban core establishing a linear pattern of development along major thoroughfares. This is evident from Torrijos Street to Taft Street of Zone 5, McKinley Street to Santiago Street and Partelo Street of Zone 4, and Capitulacion Street of Zone 1 and Zone 2.</p>
          <p >As the economic center of Abra, small scale or cottage industries abound.

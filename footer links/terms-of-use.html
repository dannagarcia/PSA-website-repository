				<h4>Terms of Use</h4>

				<p><strong>I. Privacy Policy</strong></p>
				<p>The PSA is strongly committed in protecting your privacy online.</p>
				<p>The purpose of this policy is to explain how we handle the information we collect from you during your visit to our web site. It is important to keep in mind that we do not collect personally-identifiable information (name, address, e-mail address, social security number, or other unique identifiers) on our web site unless we specifically advise you that we are doing so.</p>
				<p>PSA reserves the right to change this statement at any time by posting revisions on the PSA Web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not create any contractual or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.</p>
				
				<p class="margin30 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom"><strong><span class="mif-pin"></span> Information Collected from E-mail and Subscription Forms</strong></p>

				<p>When you send us personally-identifying information in an e-mail or through a subscription form, we use the information you provide only to help us gather the information you might request. In an effort to respond to your request, the information you submit may be viewed by various people within the PSA. Public notices issued by the PSA in which interested persons are invited to comment will contain a notice of what we intend to do with the data gathered.</p>

				<p class="margin30 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom"><strong><span class="mif-pin"></span> Security, Intrusion and Detection</strong></p>

				<p>An e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Whether or not an e-mail is "secured" depends on your software.</p>

				<p class="margin30 no-margin-top no-margin-bottom"><strong><span class="mif-pin"></span> Purchasers of PSA Products and Services</strong></p>

				<p>To order our products, you will have to provide us with personally-identifiable information to support the purchase. The information you provide may be entered into a database maintained to service our customers. While personally-identifiable information you provide is protected by law, we may be required by law to disclose the names and addresses of businesses that purchase our products.</p>

				<p><strong>II. Document Accessibility Statement</strong></p>

				<p>The PSA is committed to making every document on its internet server accessible to all. As such, we are continuously reviewing our site to insure maximum accessibility. Many of our internet documents are in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and PDF (Portable Document Format) formats which make them accessible to persons using screen reading software.</p>
				<p>Our site uses javascripts and CSS which may cause incorrect rendering of pages in some browsers. We suggest that users upgrade to the latest versions (at least version 4) of browsers so that they can experience all the features in our site.</p>

				<p><strong>III. PSA Statement on Statistical Quality and Use of Information</strong></p>

				<p><strong>IV. Links to Other Web Sites</strong></p>

				<p>The PSA Website contains links to third party sites not operated by the PSA e.g., other government sites and international statistical offices. Such sites are not within the control of the PSA and may not follow the same privacy, security, or accessibility policies as the PSA Website. Once you link to another site you are subject to the policies of that site. The PSA is not responsible for the content or availability of those sites, their partners or advertisers.</p>
				<p>The PSA provides these links only as a convenience and it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of links to relevant websites. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement of the linked site by the PSA or that the information and materials at the Website are accurate, complete or up-to-date.</p>

				<p><strong>V. Confidentiality</strong></p>

				<p>The PSA recognizes the vital role of their respondent's information. Primary data gathered by the PSA is held in strictest confidence. Balancing the policy of confidentiality with the evolving needs of society for valuable information, the PSA generally releases data in the form of summaries.</p>
				<p>Releases other than those in the form of summaries are considered when mandated by subsequent laws, and always in consideration of confidentiality.</p>

In such cases, the PSA shall not be liable for any result which is due to subsequent processing of its data by the user.</p>

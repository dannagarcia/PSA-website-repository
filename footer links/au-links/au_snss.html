					<p>The Subnational Statistical System includes all statistical organizations at the subnational level, the personnel therein and the subnational statistical programs.  It also includes:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>a policy making and coordinating body <a href="/rucar/footer links/au-links/au_rscc.html">(Regional Statistical Coordination Committee )</a>,</li>
						<li>single general purpose statistical agency ( National Statistics Office ), all the bureaus, offices, agencies and instrumentalities of the regional and local governments and all government-owned or controlled corporations and their subsidiaries that are engaged in statistical activities either as their primary functions or as part of their administrative or regulatory functions, and</li>
						<li>a single coordinating unit at the local level (National Statistical Coordination Board Regional Unit - CAR) </li>
					</ol>

					<p>Data generation activities in the government are undertaken by different agencies. In order to harmonize and integrate the statistical data produced by these agencies, as well as to enhance the efficiency of the overall statistical system, planning, coordination and policy formulation are needed. These functions are important in priority setting such that the limited government resources are allotted to the more important activities relative to demands of data users.</p>

					<p>The subnational system is an important part of the national statistical system. Its development is crucial for the overall <a href="/rucar/footer links/au-links/au_pss.html">Philippine Statistical System (PSS)</a> which need to be more responsive to government and to the general statistical needs of the country. Following the structure of the PSS, the subnational system has likewise been decentralized, with statistical operations and activities undertaken by all government offices/units.</p>

					<p>The entities considered in the management and coordination of the statistical system are the following:</p>

					<ul>
			          <li>data users - those that utilize statistics such as the planners, researchers, students, investors, and policy makers;</li>
			          <li>data producers - these include government agencies and instrumentalities which collect, process, and disseminate statistical information; </li>
			          <li> respondents - are the persons or institutions from whom the data are being collected by the data producers; </li>
			          <li>training, education and research institutions - those that conduct statistical training and researches to upgrade the capabilities of statistical manpower and improve techniques and methodologies; and </li>
			          <li>executive and legislative offices - those that provide the budgets for statistical activities and formulate government and legislative-wise policies . </li>
			        </ul>

			        <p>There are four major elements that comprise the development of the subnational statistical system toward meeting the users' demand for data:</p>

			        <ul>
			          <li>statistical planning and coordination;</li>
			          <li>data production and dissemination; </li>
			          <li>human resource development; and </li>
			          <li>research and development. </li>
			        </ul>


			        <p>It is along these strategic concerns that the assessment of the statistical system and development programs is based.</p>

					<p>Recent political and economic events and administrative reforms are influencing the statistical policies, direction and operations of the government. For years now, development administration have been moving toward greater decentralization.</p>

					<p>In accordance with the state policy enunciated in the Constitution provide for greater autonomy to the local governments in running their affairs, Republic Act No. 7160, also known as the Local Government Code of 1991 was passed to provide a more responsive and accountable local government structure. Its enactment signaled the devolution of more powers and functions from the national government to the local governments.</p>

					<p>Consequently, local government units are now beginning to assume a greater role in the formulation of local development plans and in the administration of service programs such as the social welfare, health, agricultural extension, public works and infrastructure, and housing. They will also assume regulatory functions such as the reclassification of lands, the implementation of the National Building Code, the imposition of quarantine and the enforcement of environmental laws.</p>

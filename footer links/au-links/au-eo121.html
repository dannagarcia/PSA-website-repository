				<p><strong>Reorganizing and Strengthening the Philippine Statistical System (PSS) and for Other Purposes</strong></p>

				<p>RECALLING that the reorganization of the government is mandated expressly in Article II, Section 1 (1), and Article III of the Freedom Constitution;</p>

				<p>HAVING IN MIND that, pursuant to Executive Order No. 5 (1986), there is a need to effect the necessary and proper changes in the organizational and functional structures of the government, its agencies and instrumentalities, in order to promote efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public services;</p>

				<p>BELIEVING that the present Philippine Statistical System is too decentralized, being characterized by a single general-purpose statistical agency, a number of agencies in the production of specialized statistics and other instrumentalities involved in statistical activities either as their primary functions or as part of their administrative or regulatory functions;</p>

				<p>REALIZING that the absence of a strong coordinating mechanism has given rise to the problems of duplication of activities, conflicting statistics, data gaps as well as unnecessary burden on respondents;</p>

				<p>CONSIDERING that the government needs to rationalize the allocation of resources for the collection of statistics;</p>

				<p>TAKING NOTE that the quality of statistical services is affected by the limited number of qualified statistical workers;</p>

				<p>CONVINCED that there is a need to maintain a decentralized system characterized by independence, objectivity and integrity to make it more responsive to the requirements of national development;</p>

				<p>CONVINCED further that there is also a need for a stronger mechanism to coordinate the decentralized government statistical service in order to promote the orderly development of a system capable of providing timely, accurate and useful data for the government and the public, especially for planning and decision-making;</p>

				<p>AFFIRMING that there is a need to ensure the development and maintenance of high-level statistical manpower in the government;</p>

				<p><h4>PSA launches Management Info System, revs for mid-decade census</h4></p>
				<p>The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) has developed a Management Information System (MIS) and was launched with the training of Regional Statistical Services Office (RSSO) and Central office personnel at Century Park Hotel, Manila on May 25-28, 2015.</p>

				<p>A monitoring and decision-making tool for PSA management for the 2015 Census of Population that will kick off on August 10, 2015, the MIS covers a tracking system for receipt and control of census forms, financial matters, human resource information and assistance/support extended by stakeholders, among others.</p>

				<p>With PSA RSSO Cordillera gearing toward the census count, pre-enumeration activities undertaken were the recruitment of personnel to be involved in the census-taking, convening of the Regional and Provincial Census Coordinating Boards and 75 out of 77 City/Municipal Census Boards (as of June 24) as support mechanisms, and digitization of maps to be used by enumerators using freewares such as Forestry GIS, Quantum GIS, Google Earth and Global Positioning Systems for field verification of maps.</p>

				<p>Other works lined up prior to the census-taking in August which was declared National Census Month by the Office of the President under Proclamation No. 1031 are intensive awareness campaign to raise citizenâ€™s consciousness on the census and the series of six-day trainings at the national, regional, provincial and city/municipality levels which will be held starting June 29.</p>

For instance, during harvest time, Ifugaos still celebrate with a &quot;caniao&quot; where sacrificial animals such as chickens, pigs and even carabaos are butchered. Ifugao culture is some 3,000 years old. </p>
      <p align="justify" class="style44">During their brief occupation of the province, the Spaniards established &quot;pueblos&quot; (towns) headed by the &quot;Alcalde Municipal&quot; and barangays (barrios) headed by the &quot;Cabeza de Barangay&quot;. The Spaniards largely confined their activities within Kiangan, Ifugao. Spanish rule ended with the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution. </p>

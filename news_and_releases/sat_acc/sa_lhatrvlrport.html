					<p class="align-justify"><i>Orientation-Workshop for Local Health Accounts Project<br>
					Laoagan Inn and Resort, Bulanao, Tabuk, Kalinga<br>

					<b>TRAVEL REPORT</b>
					<p><i>Day 1, May 28, 2002 (PM)</i></p>
					<p class="align-justify">The NSCB staff  first met with Ms. Cynthia Bartolo LHA point person from the Provincial Health Office (PHO) of Kalinga.  Ms. Bartolo introduced the visitors to the ICHSP officers and staff including Ms. Milagros Saguilot, ICHSP project monitoring and evaluation officer and to Dr. Romulo B. Gaerlan from the Provincial Health Office.  The NSCB staff and Ms. Bartolo then discussed and finalized arrangements for the orientation seminar scheduled the next day with Ms. Remy Mariano of the Office of Provincial Planning & Development (PPDO).</p>
					
					<p><i>Day 2, May 29, 2002 (AM)</i></p>

					<p class="align-justify">The NSCB staff together with Ms. Bartolo then paid a courtesy call to Kalinga Governor Macario Duguiang. Governor Duguiang and the provincial administrator Atty. Jerson Angog were then briefed on the background, rationale, objectives and major activities of the Local Health Accounts.  Governor Duguiang welcomed the LHA team on behalf of the province and assured them of the continuous support and cooperation of the local government.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">The LHA Team then proceeded to various LGU offices such as the Office of the Provincial Planning & Development and the Commission on Audit to confirm attendance to the activity scheduled in the afternoon. Some LHA-related data were gathered from some offices, especially from the COA. </p>

					<p><i>Day 2, May 29, 2002 (PM)</i></p>

					<b>LHA Orientation-Seminar</b>

					<p class="align-justify">The invocation was led by Aldrin Bahit of NSCB.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Ms. Remy Mariano of the PPDO-Kalinga then introduced the participants which included the head or representative from the following departments/offices: Office of the Governor, the Provincial Health Office, DOH-CAR, PPDO, COA, Treasury, Budget, etc. A total of 25 participants were present.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">On behalf of the Governor, Provincial Administrator Jerson Angog delivered the welcome remarks. He stressed the importance of the estimation of health accounts for policy and decision-making on health-related concerns.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Ms. George Saldo of NSCB-CAR shared the objectives and expected outputs of the LHA Orientation Seminar. She stressed that the main objective of activity was to orient the participants on the background and framework of the Local Health Accounts Project. Specifically, the  expected outputs included the following:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Participants familiarized with the Local Health Accounts Project</li>
						<li>Procedures, issues and problems in data collection discussed and found solutions</li>
						<li>Work plan in the implementation of the project finalized and data available collected</li>
					</ol>

					<p class="align-justify">Mr. Benjie Navarro and Mr. Aldrin Bahit   of NSCB-CAR then proceeded to orient the participants on the following: rationale of the health accounts, history of the development of the PNHA/LHA, conceptual/operational framework, data requirements of the LHA, highlights of the PNHA 1991-2000.</p>

					<b>Rationale</b>

					<p class="align-justify">Local health accounts (LHA) is a set of statistics that present spending for health care for a given province for 1 calendar year. LHA provides insights on the efficiency and effectiveness of health care financing and helps identify the appropriate interventions to improve the delivery of health care.</p>

					<b>Development of the PNHA/LHA</b>

					<ul>
						<li>Design of the PNHA (1992)</li>
						<li>Compilation of 1991-1994 PNHA (1992-95)</li>
						<li>Creation of IAC-PNHA (1995)</li>
						<li>Compilation of 1995-1997 PNHA (1998)</li>
						<li>Regular compilation of the PNHA (1999)</li>
						<li>Initial LHA Estimation (1999)</li>
						<li>ICHSP-LHA Project (2002)</li>
					</ul>

					<b>LHA Framework</b>

					<p class="align-justify">LHA attempts to answer the following health care financing concerns:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>who pays for health care (Sources)</li>
						<li>what health care services are being spent on (Uses)</li>
						<li>how much is being spent on health care by source/use (Totals)</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="align-justify">Health care expenditures by source and use are then captured using the following matrix:</p>

					<table class="table border bordered align-center">
						<tr>
							<td rowspan="3"><b>Uses of Funds</b></td>
							<td colspan="7"><b>Sources of Funds</b></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td colspan="3">Government</td>
							<td rowspan="2">Social Insurance</td>
							<td rowspan="2">Private</td>
							<td rowspan="2">Others</td>
							<td rowspan="2">TOTAL</td>

					<b>Data Requirements</b>

					<p class="align-justify">Mr. Aldrin Bahit then gave an overview of the specific data/sources required for the LHA compilation. Among others, he gave a rundown of the requirements per source of fund; namely, national and provincial/municipal government, social insurance, private and others.</p>

					<b>PNHA 1991-2000</b>

					<p class="align-justify">Mr. Navarro then concluded the lecture by sharing the findings of the 1991-2000 Philippine National Health Accounts (PNHA) and the highlights of the 1998 LHA results. On one hand, the PNHA reveals that in year 2000 more than 50 percent or half of health expenditures were financed from private sources. Government shouldered more than one-third of health spending while the national health insurance program still lagged behind and accounted for only 7.1 percent. On the other hand, the preliminary 1998 LHA estimates for Kalinga indicate that while out-of-pocket expenditures were significantly lower than the national average, health care was largely subsidized by the national and provincial government. The LHA project seeks to update the health accounts from 1998-2000 and to institutionalize its regular data generation and estimation. </p>

					<p><i>Day 3, May 30, 2002</i></p>

					<b>LHA Workshop</b>

					<p class="align-justify">The LHA team presented and familiarized the participants on the LHA worksheets for health care expenditures of the government at the national, provincial and municipal levels. The group then collectively identified the specific data sources and data gaps and other potential concerns. Time was spent on the discussion on an alternate methodology for the generation of out-of-pocket expenditures.  The group agreed to initially use the previous methodology or out-of-pocket expenditures subject to future improvements. Based on the discussion, the group then drafted a work plan to facilitate the compilation work.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">A meeting with Mrs. Milagros Saguilot and Ms. Cynthia Bartolo then followed in the afternoon. They oriented the NSCB staff on the details of the ICHSP implementation in Kalinga.  Moreover, in addition to construction of health care facilities and the acquisition of related equipment, they shared the initiatives of the province in alternate health care financing options such as the  Ambigatton , an innovative pharmacy cooperative that has been providing critical drugs at substantially lower prices to the general public.</p>

					<p><i>Day 4, May 31, 2002</i></p>

					<b>Data Gathering</b>

					<p class="align-justify">The LHA team continued to gather data on actual ICHSP obligations for 1998-2000 and were able to secure various ICHSP and other health-related expenditures thanks to the assistance of PHO, PPDO and COA.  Data gathered included ICHSP financial and narrative reports and other health care documentation.</p>

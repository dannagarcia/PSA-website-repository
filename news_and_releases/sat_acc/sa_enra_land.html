					<p><b class="fg-brown">LAND AND SOIL RESOURCES DEVOTED TO AGRICULTURAL USES</b></p>
					<p class="align-justify">Land and soil resources are important in the regional and national economy.  The increasing population in the region underscores the need to conserve and manage soil resources as to maintain or improve productivity of the land. This makes it imperative to implement the proper valuation of lands devoted to agricultural uses in order that policies can be made to conserve, manage and protect the remaining agricultural lands.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Land resources devoted to agricultural uses in the Cordillera decreased by an average rate of 3.4 percent annually.  In 1990 there were 161.04  thousand hectares of agricultural lands but by 1998 there were only 122.21 thousand hectares left for agricultural uses. </p>
					<p class="align-justify">For the eight year period, the value however, posted an increasing trend. The opening stock of 166.69 thousand hectares in 1990 was valued at 6.8 billion pesos.  By 1998 the opening stock of 126.5 thousand hectares was valued at 13.6 billion pesos.  This is equivalent to about 855 million pesos annual average increase for the eight year period.  For the closing stocks, the 161.04 thousand hectares of land in 1990 was valued  at 7.5 billion pesos.  By 1998, it was priced at 14.6 billion pesos.  On a per hectare basis, this is equivalent to about 45.66 thousand pesos in 1990 and about 119.63 thousand pesos in 1998.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">A change in the quality of soil lies in changes in their nutrient content.  Nutrient loss shows a decreasing trend which may be the result of the decreasing erosion and sedimentation.  The soil eroded from lands used for agricultural purpose, amounts to  a total of 8,436,917 metric tons in 1990 declining to 6,402,553 metric tons in 1998.  However, degradation which is valued as the fertilizer equivalent of nutrient loss posted an increasing trend.  The value of degradation in 1990 was estimated at 19.1 million pesos and reached 20.7 million pesos in 1998 or an 8.4 percent increase. Increases in annual degradation may be due to inappropriate farming practices which deplete the soil's nutrients.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Taking into consideration that the annual decrease in areas devoted to agricultural uses is 3.4%, concerned government agencies should look into this and come up with strategic interventions regarding land use conversion.  Furthermore, the enactment of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA) and the identification of Strategic Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Zones (SAFDZs) will hopefully maintain and develop agricultural lands.</p>

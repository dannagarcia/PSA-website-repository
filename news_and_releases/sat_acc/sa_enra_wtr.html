					<p class="align-justify">Water resource is mobile and it occurs as both stock and flow.  Water involves economies of large scale and these are evident in water storage, conveyance and distribution.  Surface water tends to flow, evaporate, transpire and seep while groundwater exists as a stock usually subject to recharge flows.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">CAR is endowed by nature with several rivers and creeks. As host to 13 major and principal river systems, the region prides itself as the watershed cradle of Northern Luzon.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">The opening stock of surface water in the region in 1991, 1994 and 1997 substantially decreased and significantly increased in 1995, 1996 and 1998.  The decrease may be attributed to the El Nino phenomenon while the increase may be due to La Nina which is associated with above normal rainfall.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">The agriculture sector contributes about 99 percent of total abstraction of water with water consumption increasing over time.  From 2.6 billion cubic meters in 1990 to nearly 3.0 billion cubic meters in 1998 or on the average of about  2.84 billion cubic meters of water consumed for the agriculture sector yearly.  Domestic consumption also increased from 1990-1998 posting an annual average consumption of 24.77 million cubic meters.  Industry abstraction is considered zero since major industries within the region generally source their water requirements from aquifers rather than from  rivers and streams.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">The overall stock of surface water in 1998 registered a recovery of its 1990 level despite severe fluctuations in the period in between. The trend of stocks showed that though it can recover after some period, it can also decline by around 10 billion cubic meters as experienced in 1991, 1994 and 1997</p>
					<p class="align-justify">This water account is just part of the total accounting of natural resources in a watershed. However, said account can serve as a valuable input in the development of a comprehensive and sustainable resource and management plan in a given watershed or ecosystem.</p>

					<p><b class="fg-green">FOREST RESOURCES</b></p>
					<p class="align-justify">Forests are vital natural resources.  They provide timber and non-timber products, serve as the main watersheds of rivers, streams and creeks and habitat of diverse flora and fauna which are important genetic sources of medicine, food and other products of economic use.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Forests in the Cordillera are classified into three major types, namely: mossy, pine and dipterocarp.  As of 1998, the region's old and second growth dipterocarp forest consisted of 204,700 hectares and 316,910 hectares, respectively.  This is equivalent to 33 percent of the region's  total forest land of 1.56 million hectares.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Closing volume in old growth dipterocarp forest remain almost unchanged for the eight-year period, in contrast to the second growth dipterocarp forest where closing volume increased by 5.73 percent.  On the other hand, volume for second growth dipterocarp forest grew steadily during the accounting period.  The opening volume in 1990 was 21.23 million cubic meters and increased by a high of 56 percent to reach 33.15 million cubic meters at the end of the accounting period.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">There was a very minimal change in the value of standing trees in old growth dipterocarp forest.  From 6.605 million pesos in 1990 to 6.604 million pesos in 1998 or only about .0008 percent.  Surprisingly, the value of standing trees in second growth dipterocarp forest posted a 63.9 percent increase, from 2.96 million pesos in 1990 to 4.85 million pesos in 1998.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">In the same period, pine forest covered 80,375 hectares or about 5.16 percent of the region's total forest land.  Of this pine forest, 68 percent is closed forest and 32 percent is open forest.  Timber stand volume reduced from 8.418 million cubic meters in 1990 to only 8.320 million cubic meters in 1998. This reduction is attributed to legal logging and unauthorized cutting.</p>
					<p class="align-justify">Cordillera has a significant area devoted to forestry. With its forest land constituting about 85 percent, the region exceeds the 60-40 ideal forest-to-non-forest ratio.  The minimal volume reduction in dipterocarp forests was due to the implementation of the log ban in the region.  Volume reductions have significant impact on existing stand volume thus the need for an even more effective implementation of forest protection programs in these types of forests.  Considering the high rate of natural stand growth in second dipterocarp forests, the present policy of selective logging is  a sustainable management option.</p>

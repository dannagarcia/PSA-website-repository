					<b>The Environment and Natural Resources Accounting Project:<br> 
					The Philippine Economic-Environmental and Natural Resources Accounting 
					(PEENRA) System </b>
					<p class="align-justify">As the Cordillera economy continues to capitalize on its water, forest, mineral and other natural resources in its quest for higher economic growth, concerns have been raised as to the physical and monetary impact of  this economic growth on the  environment. The question of long-term sustainable growth has been raised and begs to be answered.</p>

					<p class="align-justify">The piloting of PEENRA in the region, under funding support from the UNDP aimed to generate physical and monetary estimates of the depletion of selected natural resources and the degradation of environmental media due to selected economic activities. Moreover, the piloting also aimed to determine the feasibility and usefulness of environmental accounting at the regional level.</p>

					<p class="align-justify">PEENRA is in line with the desire of the region to build and institutionalize an updated databank of sustainable development indicators, a key strategy of the  CAR Regional Development Plan. The databank will provide sufficient and timely knowledge about the state of CAR's watersheds and its natural resources. It is expected to improve policy-making for natural resources management and help identify appropriate industries that should be encouraged and supported  within the region.</p>

					<b>OBJECTIVES</b>

					<ol>
						<li>Develop and operationalize the PEENRA System in the region;</li>
						<li>Enhance the capacity of government personnel in the concepts and compilation methodologies of the PEENRA System;</li>
						<li>Integrate Environment and Natural Resources (ENR) management concerns in regional socioeconomic planning and policy-making; and</li>
						<li>Strengthen inter-agency coordination and networking.</li>
					</ol>

					<b>ENRA-CAR SCOPE AND COVERAGE</b>

					<p class="align-justify">The PEENRA-CAR accounts cover four resources and two economic activities covering an eight-year period, from 1990 to 1998, except for manufacturing which covers the period 1995 to 1999. The resources and economic activities were selected based on their contribution to the regional economy, impact to the environment and availability of the required data. </p>

					<ol>
						<li><b>Regional Asset Accounts</b>
							<p class="align-justify">The regional asset accounts (except for water) include both physical and monetary estimates for the depletion of key natural resources. For minerals, we have gold, copper and limestone. For forest, we have pine and dipterocarp. For land and soil, we focused on land for agricultural purposes. Last, we are compiling a physical account for surface water.</p>
						</li>
						<li><b>Regional Economic Activity Accounts</b></a>
							<p class="align-justify">The regional accounts for economic activities are estimates of the degradation to the environment due to two major activities; namely, manufacturing and agriculture. Manufacturing focuses on the semiconductor industry while agriculture is limited to the degradation costs of a major local crop.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

				<b>Project Organization and Activities</b>

				<p class="align-justify">In 1999, t he NSCB, in partnership with the regional offices of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) and other concerned agencies, adopted and piloted the PEENRA  in CAR.</p>
				<p class="align-justify">NSCB formed a regional technical working group (RTWG) for each of the four resources and two economic activities covered by the project. For resources we have forestry, land/soil, mineral, water while for economic activities we have manufacturing and agriculture</p>
				<p class="align-justify">Upon organization of the RTWGs, NSCB conducted trainings to orient the members of the PEENRA framework, concepts and compilation methodologies. Activities included a data assessment workshop, on-site visits and regular meetings.</p>
				<p class="align-justify">The respective RTWGs conducted extensive data-gathering for the compilation of the accounts under technical supervision from the NSCB.</p>

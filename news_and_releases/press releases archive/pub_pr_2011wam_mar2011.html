				<p>PR 201101-RDCAR-1<br>31 MARCH 2011</p>
				<p><h4>NSCB-CAR Releases 2011 Statistical Handbook on Women and Men in the Cordillera Administrative Region</h4></p>

				<p>March is Women's Month by virtue of Proclamation 227 which provides for the observance of women's role in history. To celebrate the Women's Month, NSCB-CAR releases 2011 updates on the Statistical Handbook on Women and Men (WAM) in Cordillera Administrative Region. WAM is a regular publication of the NSCB regional divisions in support of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), in which the Philippine Government is among the signatories. Moreover, WAM is also published to help monitor the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Declaration adopted by the member-countries of the United Nations (UN) in which one of the eight (8) main development goals under the said declaration seeks to promote gender equality and empowerment of women.</p>

				<p>The Women and Men Statistical Handbook presents the latest available gender statistics, from both official and administrative sources, on the different priority sectors of gender concerns in the region. Data for provinces and key cities are also provided whenever possible. This publication is an affirmation of our commitment towards the realization of the visions of the Philippine Plan for Gender-Responsive Development and in fulfilling the various international commitments of our country to gender concerns. For the third edition, additional gender-disaggregated information data is provided in the chpaters on Vital, Health and Family Planning, Education, Social Welfare and Development, and Violence Against Women.</p>

				<p>It is hoped that this publication will be a significant source of information for decision-makers, project planners, implementers and evaluators to guide them in their advocacy work and in formulating effective plans, programs and policies for the advancement of women in the Cordilleras. The publication, Women and Men in CAR: 2011 Statistical Handbook, 3rd Edition (CD-ROM version), is now available at the National Statistical Information Center (NSIC) library of the NSCB. The CAR Branch is currently located at #39 Upper Engineer's Hill, Baguio City. For inquiries on the 2011 WAM, kindly contact Mr. Aldrin Bahit or Ms. Georgina Saldo, NSCB Regional Division CAR.</p>

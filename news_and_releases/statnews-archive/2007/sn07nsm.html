				<p><h4>October is National Statistics Month</h4></p>

				<p>The Philippine Statistical System will once again celebrate the National Statistics Month (NSM) this coming month of October 2007. This will be the 18 th year that said event is being celebrated. Several statistical events are slated for the month-long observance meant to promote, enhance and instill nationwide awareness and appreciation of the importance and value of statistics, in measuring our progress in attaining the MDGs.</p>

				<p>Why MDGs? Because this year's theme is: Statistics and Action: A Road to a Better Life Through the MDGs. In the words of former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, “ … Success will require sustained action across the entire decade between now and the deadline. It takes time to train the teachers, nurses and engineers; to build the roads, schools and hospitals; to grow the small and large businesses able to create the jobs and income needed. So we must start now. And we must more than double global development assistance over the next few years. Nothing less will help to achieve the Goals."</p>

				<p>In the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), statistics play a very crucial and significant role. Statistics provide the basis for monitoring progress achieved on such sustained action since 1990 – how we stood at the beginning of the period, where we were at specific intervals of time, and consequently, determine at what pace these developments took place in order for us to assess and project or estimate if our targets are achievable at this pace. Being well informed of these STATISTICS is important for the national and local governments and our development partners to take proper ACTION and implement targeted strategies leading to the ROAD TO A BETTER LIFE in 2015 and beyond.</p>

				<p>Thus, with statistics giving impetus to action, our road to a better life means:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger</li>
						<li>Achieving universal primary education</li>
						<li>Promoting gender equality and empowering women</li>
						<li>Reducing child mortality</li>
						<li>Improving maternal health</li>
						<li>Combatting HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases</li>
						<li>Ensuring environmental sustainability, and</li>
						<li>Developing a global partnership for development</li>
					</ul>

				<h5>13th National Statistics Month Celebration, October 2002</h5>

				

				<p>The country will again celebrate the National Statistics Month (NSM) pursuant to<a href=""> Presidential Proclamation No. 647</a>  “Declaring the Month of October Every Year as the National Statistics Month.” For this purpose, the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) has issued <a href="">Memorandum Circular No. 01-02</a>  on June 3, 2002 enjoining all government agencies at the national and subnational levels and the private sector to actively support and participate the celebration of the 13th NSM. </p>

				<p>The observance of this event has a two-fold objective: (a) to promote, enhance and instill nationwide awareness and appreciation of the importance and value of statistics, and (b) to elicit the cooperation and support of the general public in upgrading the quality and standard of statistics in the country. This year's theme is Responsive Statistics for Good Governance. </p>

				<p>Call for activities to be undertaken by cooperating agencies is now open. Activities that are relevant to the theme may be in the form of symposia, workshops, orientation seminars, exhibits, lecture, statistical quiz show, slide shows, motorcade, parade and publication of statistical reports, indicators and other relevant information. Each agency may choose to have its own sub-theme, depending on the focus and direction of its preferred statistical activities. Kindly use NSM Form 1 which can be submitted via <a href="mailto:nscbcar@mozcom.com?subject=13th%20NSM%20Activities"> e-mail.</a></p>

				<p>To give us sufficient time to consolidate and finalize the NSM Calendar of Activities, we would appreciate receiving your proposed activities <a href="http://www.nscb.gov.ph/rucar/nsm_form1.xls">(NSM Form 1)</a>  on or before 15 August 2002. Participating agencies are also encouraged to display their own NSM streamers throughout the month of October and disseminate the calendar of activities, posters and other promotional materials within their offices.</p>

				<p>Kindly send all communications regarding the NSM to the following address:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The RSCC Secretariat </li>
						<li>c/o National Statistical Coordination Board </li>
						<li>2/F 39 Engineer's Hil, Baguio City </li>

						<li>e-mail:<a href="mailto:nscbcar@mozcom.com?subject=13th%20NSM%20Activities">nscbcar@mozcom.com</a></li>

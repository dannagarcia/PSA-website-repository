				<p><h4>PSDP workshop conducted in CAR</h4></p>

				<p>The regional consultation workshop in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) for the formulation of the Subnational Statistical Development Chapter of the 2011-2017 Philippine Statistical Development Program (PSDP) was held last 14 July 2011 at the DPWH Conference Room, Upper Engineer's Hill, Baguio City. The workshop was conducted by NSCB-CAR staff and was attended by 20 participants from 15 regional line agencies (RLAs) and 2 local government units (LGUs).</p>

				<p>The PSDP is a periodically formulated statistical development program which cuts across various sectors of society and encompasses the statistical activities of the entire government. It is a tool for integrating and coordinating the statistical activities of the government. As the main purpose of statistics is to serve society, the PSDP acts as the statistical blueprint of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) now known as the Philippine Development Plan (PDP). The 2011-2017 PSDP will address the information requirements of the 2010-2016 PDP and lay the necessary framework for generating statistics and indicators needed by various stakeholders and data users including those from the private sector. This will be the ninth (9th) PSDP. The previous versions covered 1976-2000, 1978-1982, 1983-1987, 1990-1992, 1993-1995, 1993-1998, 1999-2004, and 2005-2010.</p>

				<p>The chapter on subnational statistics of the PSDP aims to develop the subnational statistical system by identifying statistical programs/activities on the following areas of concern:</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Statistical Planning, Coordination and Advocacy; </li>
						<li>Data Production;</li>
						<li>Data Dissemination and Utilization; </li>
						<li>Research and Capacity Building; and</li>
						<li>Human and Financial Resources.</li>
					</ol>

				<p>The NSCB-CAR had earlier sent PSDP forms to RLAs and LGUs in order to solicit concerns and proposed programs for the improvement of the regional statistical system. The accomplished forms were then sent back to NSCB for processing and consolidation. The consolidated report was discussed during the workshop. The report presented the (1) major statistical accomplishments of the region; (2) issues and concerns; and (3) proposed major statistical development programs/activities for the subnational statistical system. The consultative workshop solicited further comments and suggestions from the stakeholders of the subnational statistics. Inputs for the subnational chapter will be presented during the national consultation workshop to be held before the end of August 2011.</p>

				<p>As the NSCB want the PSDP to be able to serve the information needs of the greatest number of data users given the limited manpower and financial resources of the government, we invite all concerned sectors in the region to email your data needs and other statistical concerns in the medium term to nscbcar@yahoo.com.</p>

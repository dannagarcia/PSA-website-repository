				<p><h4>CAR economy grows by 3.0% in 2003</h4></p>

				
				<p>The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR)'s economy registered a lower growth of 3.0 percent in 2003 from 4.3 percent in 2002.  This was brought about by the slowdown in the Industry sector and the contraction in Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry (AFF) sectors.</p>

				<p>The AFF, which accounted for the 13.1 percent of the region's total output, contracted at the rate if 2.6 percent largely due to the vegetable importation and extensive damages to crops brought about by the devastating typhoon.</p>

				<p>Several factors contributed to the slowdown in the Industry sector's performance.  Mining and Quarrying, which contributed 11.1 percent tot eh Cordillera economy, decelerated to 14.0 percent in 2003 from 18.2 percent in 2002.  The decline in gold production, which accounted for the biggest chunk of the mining industry, pulled down the modest gains in copper production.  Construction, which accounted for for 7.2 percent of the region's output, dropped by 12.0 percent due to substantial slowdown in government infrastructure activities.  Manufacturing remains the prime mover of the Industry sector with a share of 40.1 percent but its growth of 4.2 percent was not able to offset the shrinkage in the other sectors.</p>

				<p>The Services sector, which contributed 22.4 percent to the region's economy, slightly decelerated to 5.0 percent in 2003 from 5.3 percent in 2002 but still the strongest performer.  Private Services boosted the growth of the Services sector with its 4.4 percent expansion due to the significant increase in private schools enrolment and upsurge in the number of new hotels in Baguio City.</p>

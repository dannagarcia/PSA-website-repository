				<p><h4>Tourist arrivals in the Cordilleras grow in 2013</h4></p>

				<p>Tourist arrivals in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) grew by 22.8 percent last year or from 907,830 travelers in 2012 to 1,114,440 in 2013.* The decline by 18.0 percent of visiting overseas Filipinos or balikbayan was offset by the increase in both domestic and foreign visitors which grew by 22.0 percent and 33.3 percent, respectively. The increase in tourists in CAR was due to the influx of domestic travelers which comprised 90.5 percent to the regional total. This is based on the latest statistical report of the region’s Department of Tourism (DOT-CAR).</p>

				<p>In 2013, travelers to Mt. Province soared by 70.1 percent, the fastest growth rate within the region. This was due to the substantial increase in domestic and foreign visitors by 73.7 percent and 58.8 percent, respectively. In addition to Mt. Province, two other areas which posted growth higher than the region’s average were Apayao (47.9%) and Baguio City (36.7%).</p>

				<p>Despite of the region’s high growth, tourist arrivals in the provinces of Benguet and Kalinga declined by 32.9 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively in 2013. Benguet had less domestic visitors while Kalinga registered a decrease in foreign travelers during the year.</p>

				<p>During the period, Baguio City had the most number of tourist arrivals with a total of 843,473 visitors or 75.7 percent of the regional total in 2013. Benguet followed with a total of 105,052 travelers or 9.4 percent of total CAR visitors.</p>

				<p>By country of origin, many foreign visitors in 2012 and 2013 came from South Korea, United States, France, Germany, Japan and Canada.</p>

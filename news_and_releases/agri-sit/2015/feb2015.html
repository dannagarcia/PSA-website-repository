									On the other hand, harvesting of white corn was already noted in some parts
									of the province particularly in San Quintin. </li>
	                    		<li>In Apayao, palay and corn were mostly in the vegetative state except for
									those that were planted early which were already in the maturing stage.
									Repair of the main irrigation canal servicing the municipalities of Flora and
									Sta.Marcela was concluded thereby allowing planting of all irrigated palay
									areas in the two municipalities.</li>

									municipalities of Pinukpuk and Rizal. On the other hand, vegetative stage of
									palay was observed in Tabuk City, Pasil and Balbalan. Usage of certified rice
									seeds was noted in some barangays of upper Pinukpuk. Meanwhile,
									harvesting of corn has started during the last week of the reference month.

										conducted deworming activities in the municipality having treated a total of
										15 hogs and 5 carabaos. The activity was done in cooperation with the
										barangay officials. The MAO of Flora provided the vaccines and medicines
										for the animals.</li>

									land preparation activities. The sporadic occurrence of rains delayed
									planting on rainfed areas.</li>

	                    	<ul>
	                    		<li>In Apayao, BFAR CAR in cooperation with LGU Flora distributed cast nets
							to selected beneficiaries. The activity aimed to increase the catch on
							municipal inland. The nets were given free.</li>
								<li>In Ifugao, fishpond and fish cage production slowed down. Production
							was affected by prolonged dry season and unusually hot climatic
							conditions caused by mild El Nino. Water level at Magat dam was 178
							meters within the normal range. There was adequate supply of irrigation
							water from the NIA Hapid Irrigation Canal in the municipality of Lamut
							and Mariz dam in the municipality of Alfonso Lista.</li>
								<li>In Kalinga, low production in aquaculture farms was observed while more
							catch in municipal inland fishery due to the low water level. </li>
								<li>In Mt. Province, some fishpond operators in Bauko municipality were
							beneficiaries of tilapia fingerlings from the provincial government as well
							as BFAR-CAR. The same support was extended by the provincial local
							government unit to some fishpond operators in Sagada municipality.</li>

	                    		<li>In Abra, price of rice commodities were observed to be much higher
									during this period wherein ordinary rice was retailed at P36.00. The reason
									for such change is the scarce supply available for trade.</li>
	                    		<li>In Apayao, retail prices of most agricultural commodities declined over
									last month’s prices due to more volume of local supply as well as inflow
									from neighboring provinces.</li>
	                    		<li>In Benguet, supply of most highland vegetables such as carrots, radish,
									white potato, celery was deficit which caused the prices to escalate.</li>
	                    		<li>In Ifugao, prices of vegetables, fruits, fish, livestock and poultry were within
									the normal level for the period covered. There was adequate supply of
									vegetables, fish and poultry in the market.</li>
	                    		<li>In Kalinga, more supply of ripe carabao mango was observed due to
									peak harvest.</li>
	                    		<li>In Mt. Province, no fast movement of retail prices of commodities was
									observed except for ginger.</li>

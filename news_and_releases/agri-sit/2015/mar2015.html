	                    		<li>In Abra, still in progress was transplanting of irrigated palay particularly in the
									municipality of Bangued. Average yield per hectare of palay and corn was
									observed to be lower than last year which was attributed to inadequate
									water supply during the reproductive stage of both crops. Trading of
									mangoes and Virginia tobacco was also noted.</li>
	                    		<li>In Apayao, most palay and corn areas were on the maturing stage while
									some were already harvested. The continuous good warm weather
									experienced during the reference period helped hasten the ripening of
									grains.</li>
	                    		<li>
	                    			In Ifugao, leafy and fruit vegetable production slightly increased in most
									municipalities. There was no reported significant pest infestation in the
									province. 
	                    		</li>
	                    		<li>
	                    			In Kalinga, harvesting of palay was already on-going in the municipalities of
									Pinukpuk and Rizal while in in other municipalities like Pasil, Balbalan and
									Tabuk City, palay was noted still on the reproductive stage. Meanwhile,
									harvesting of corn was at its peak
	                    		</li>
	                    		<li>
	                    			In Mt. Province, there was delayed threshing and drying of yellow corn due to
									occurrence of rainfall on the last week of the month particularly in Paracelis
									where harvest was at its peak. Planting of palay was on-going in all
									municipalities except Paracelis.

				                    <li>In Abra, trading of large animals in LOM Dolores and small animals in LOM
										Bangued was observed to be in normal situation. </li>
									<li>In Ifugao, a total of 192,900 marketable broilers and 7,000 culled layers was
										shipped out of the province. There was no reported disease outbreak in the
										province for the period covered.</li> 
									<li>In Mt. Province, a total of thirty-two female heads of cattle aging 18 months
										were dispersed during the month to selected raisers in Bauko, Tadian,
										Sagada, Bontoc, and Besao by the Department of Agriculture through the
										Office of the Provincial Veterinarian.

	                    	<ul>
	                    		<li>In Apayao some fishpond operators temporarily stopped their operation due
									to drying up of ponds and lack of capital. This was verified by the
									AT/Municipal Fishery Coordinator of MAO Conner.
								</li>
								<li>In Ifugao, fishpond and fish cage production increased. There was no
									reported fish kill during the period. Water level at Magat dam was beginning to recede below normal range. On the other hand, there was adequate
									supply of irrigation water from the NIA Hapid Irrigation Canal in the
									municipality of Lamut and Mariss dam in Alfonso Lista.</li>
								<li>In Kalinga, tilapia fingerlings were distributed to fishpond operators of
									barangays Tanglag, Antonio Canao, Dangoy, Mabilong and Poblacion, all in
									the municipality of Lubuagan. Some fishponds dried up due to scarcity of
									water supply in the municipality of Rizal. Meanwhile, more catch was noted
									on municipal waters due to low water level</li>

	                    	<h5>PRICES AND MARKET SITUATION</h5>
	                    	<ul>
	                    		<li>In Abra, normal supply of locally produced vegetables was observed.
									Declining prices were noted particularly for eggplant, tomato, upo and
									squash due to peak harvest</li>
	                    		<li>In Apayao, prices of agricultural commodities were mostly the same as last
									month. Minimal trading of cereal commodities was observed with prices lower
									than last quarter due to absence of transient traders. Dried palay was
									registered at P16-17/kg while corn was P 11.50-12/kg.</li>
	                    		<li>In Benguet, supply of agricultural commodities particularly highland
									vegetables was deficit that caused the prices to escalate by 20% - 50%.
									 In Ifugao, prices of vegetables, fruits, fish, livestock and poultry were within the
									normal level for the period covered.</li>
	                    		<li>In Mt. Province, normal supply of agricultural commodities was observed at
									Bontoc Public Market.

	                   			<li>In Abra, construction of Ikmin Bridge and approaches in Sallapadan was
								going on. Moreover, the Department of Social Welfare and Development
								(DSWD) has turned over a farm-to-market road (FMR) to the community of
								Brgy. Benben, municipality of La Paz. This would benefit 135 households in the
								area whose major source of income mostly comes from crops production and
								handicrafts. With this FMR, transport of goods to Poblacion and Bangued
								would be easier. The community-built 100 linear meter road was
								implemented under the Kalahi-CIDSS.</li>
	                   			<li>In Apayao, two newly constructed MPDPs in the municipality of Conner,
								particularly, in barangays Ili and Cupis were turned over to the care of farmer
								beneficiaries. Each MPDP cost P 150,000.00 which was funded by DA CAR.</li>
	                   			<li>In Benguet, the Department of Agriculture – Cordillera Administrative Region
								(DA-CAR) through its High Value Crops Development Program turned over a
								coffee processing center to the Atok Arabica coffee growers and Marketing
								Cooperative (ACOGMAC) in Caliking, Atok on March 6, 2015. Aside from the
								processing center, the DA-CAR-HVCDP and the CHARMP2 also provided
								other facilities such as coffee pulper, roasting machines, dehuller, bagger,
								seedlings, moisture meter and others, including capital. PRDP is now working
								on coffee as the first priority commodity of the Cordillera Region</li>
	                   			<li>In Ifugao, rehabilitation of Anao-Burnay irrigation system was fully completed
								benefiting 30 palay farming households.
								</li>
								<li>In Kalinga, there was an on-going construction of one (1) multi-purpose
								pavement at barangay Poblacion, Lubuagan funded by DA CAR.</li>

	                    		<li>In Apayao, a Farmers Field School (FFS) with about 25 participants was goingon
								in Caglayan, Conner wherein High Yield Technology Adaptation (HYTA)

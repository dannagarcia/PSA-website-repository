					        	<p class="align-justify">Official poverty statistics in the Philippines are generated by the National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) with geographic disaggregation from the national up to the provincial level. In addition to the official statistics, there are several ongoing efforts to generate other poverty indicators' with disaggregation below the provincial level. The wealth of poverty statistics at the subnational level offers an opportunity for an integrated poverty mapping system that shows the various dimensions of poverty and allows users of poverty statistics a micro perspective on the poverty situation in the Philippines. While several efforts have been exerted in the past to produce poverty maps, sustainability and institutionalization have not been achieved. In recognition of the need to regularly provide planners and decision makers with useful tools for the formulation of poverty reduction strategies, the NSCB has initiated efforts to produce poverty maps for all the provinces of the country.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The Minimum Basic Needs framework with its three major concerns of survival, enabling and security, was used as basis for selecting the measures of poverty because this was deemed to contain indicators that are already being measured and collected at the municipal level, the framework having been in place for several years now. Thus, indexes were computed out of the indicators for the components of the three major concerns of SURVIVAL, SECURITY and ENABLING.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The municipal indexes were plotted on the maps using GIS tools and technology. Maps were made for the individual indicators, the composite indexes and the over-all poverty index for selected provinces of the region. The same approach has been employed for Baguio but with diaggregation down to the barangay level.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The poverty maps serve as very useful tools to local government units as well as local chief executives particularly in identifying priority areas that should benefit from anti-poverty programs and interventions. The poverty maps will be generated for provinces and the lone city of the Cordillera region to assess and address the weaknesses of its municipalities in terms of improving the quality of lives of its citizens.</p>

					        <div class="frame bg-grayLighter fg-gray" id="2">
					        	<p class="align-justify">The indicators used by NSCB in constructing the maps were based on the Minimum Basic Needs (MBN) indicators that have been derived thru inter-agency collaboration. HOwever, appropriate proxy/additional indicators available in the municipal level were also used in the absence of/in addition to the MBN-identified indicators.</p>

					        	<b>The following steps were undertaken in the computation of poverty indicators.</b>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The poverty mapping methodology developed by the NSCB was distinct from other poverty mapping activities being undertaken by other agencies. The indicators from the Minimum Basic Needs framework for the three major concerns of survival, security, and enabling were collected at the barangay level from the various city departments and selected line agencies. Data submitted were carefully assessed and validated to check the data quality in terms of consistency and presence of outliers/extreme values.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The methodology involved the computation of a composite index out of the indicators for the components of the three major MBN concerns of SURVIVAL, SECURITY, and ENABLING. The component indexes are derived as the means (or simple arithmetic average) of their respective indicators. Thus, the HEALTH INDEX would be the average of the child mortality rate and maternal mortality rate. The composite POVERTY INDEX is then obtained as the unweighted arithmetic average of the indexes for the three major components.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The individual indicators were converted into unit-less measures since these indicators were not expressed in the same units and, therefore, could not be aggregated. For example, the CMR is expressed as the number of child deaths per 1,000 live births, while drop-out rates are in terms of percentages. Conversion into unit-less measures of the indicators is done by first deriving the city values of the indicator. The barangay values of the indicators are then divided by the city values if the comparison is to be made among barangays of the same city. The resulting quotients are called INDEXES.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">Ideally, it would have been desirable to compare the barangay values against a city target that might have been specified in the city development plan or against a standard set by the concerned agency, such as the Department of Health or the Department of Education. In this exercise, in the absence of a set city target, the city value of the indicator was used as the basis for the comparison among the barangays. No weights were used to derive the city value as raw data were available. The city value is simply derived as the ratio of the total of the barangay values to the total relevant population. All the barangay indicators were converted into unit-less values so they could be aggregated to derive the composite index at the city level.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The use of the city value against which the situation of the barangays are compared enables the users to rank the performance of the barangays within the city for each of the indicators.</p>

					        </div>
					        <div class="frame bg-grayLighter fg-gray" id="4">
					        	<p class="align-justify">The barangay indices are plotted using GIS tools and technology. Maps are made for the individual indicators, the composite indices and the over-all poverty index.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">Five intervals were used in the maps to reflect the situation of the municipalities. Two intervals with ranges 0-49 % and 50-99% represented the performance of the municipalities whose conditions were better than the provincial values. The 100-149% range included the municipalities with performance no better than or slightly poorer than the provincial condition. Similarly, the ranges 150-199 % and 200-699% indicated poorer performance of the municipalities.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The lower values were represented by darker shades of green and the higher values were presented by lighter shades, thus a darker shade of green portrayed a better situation than the lighter shades of green. The figure below illustrates the map of the peace and order situation in Albay in 2000. The municipalities with better peace and order relative to the whole province were shaded with dark green, whereas those with poorer peace and order were represented with light green.</p>

					        	<p class="align-justify">In the case of the poverty maps prepared for the City of Baguio, seven (7) intervals are used in the maps. Three intervals with ranges 0-33.9 percent (best) , 34-66.9 percent (better) and 67-99.9 percent (good) represent the performance of the barangays whose achievements are better than the average city values.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The 100-133.9 percent range would include the barangays with performance at least equal to but not more than one-and-a-half times the city value. Similarly, the 134-166.9 percent (bad), 167-199.9 percent (worse) and 200 percent and over (worst) ranges would indicate the barangays which are below the city average.</p>

				        		</div>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The poverty maps applied a brown to green color scheme. This is to better distinguish the difference between the barangays and readily identify barangays that need intervention. Having seven intervals, one class is in the shade of brown, two classes are in the shades of red, three are in the shades of green and one that is in the middle uses the shade of light yellow. The white color is used to portray an area without data/missing data.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">The three intervals of 0-33.9 percent, 34-66.9 percent and 67-99.9 percent use the shades of green, using a darker shade of green for 0-33.9 percent, a lighter shade of green for 34-66.9 percent and the lightest shade of green for the 67-99.9 percent interval. Thus, a darker shade of green portrays the best situation as compared to the other barangays of the city. The light yellow shade is portrayed with the values 100-133.9 percent. This range is within the city index of 100, meaning indices less than 100 percent indicates a better situation than the overall performance of the province.</p>
					        	<p class="align-justify">Those indices that have a higher value than 100 percent indicate a worse situation than the city performance. Three intervals are used for this, the 134-166.9 percent, the 167-199.9 percent and the 200 percent and over interval. The first two intervals use shades of red to portray the alarming performance of the barangays. The dark brown shade is used for the 200 percent and above interval so that it would give the viewer an instant picture of which area has an alarming situation or has the worst situation among the barangays within the city.</p>

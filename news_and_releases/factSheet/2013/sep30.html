				<h4 style="color:red;">Crime Incidence in the Cordilleras declines in 2nd Quarter 2013</h4>
				<p>The crime incidence in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) declined by 6.0 percent or from 4,125 to 3,878 crimes reported for the 1st quarter and 2nd quarter 2013, respectively. The overall decline in crimes for the period was due to the 14.7 percent drop in index crimes which offset the 6.9 percent increase in non-index crimes.</p>

				<p>In terms of crime solution efficiency, Abra was the sole province within CAR which had solved more than half of its recorded crimes with a crime solution efficiency rate (CSER) of 54.5 percent reported in 2nd quarter 2013. All other provinces, including Baguio City recorded a CSER of 30.0 percent and below during the same period.</p>
				<p>In terms of the proportion of recorded crimes in CAR during the 2nd quarter of 2013, Baguio City accounted for more than two-thirds (68%) of total crimes which included other non-index crimes and theft. Benguet province accounted for 17 percent while each of the other CAR provinces contributed only 4 percent or less to total crimes.</p>

				</p>

				<p>Less crimes were reported within the region during the 2nd quarter of this year. Crimes against persons decreased by 17.3 percent due to less incidents of physical injury. Crimes against property dropped by 12.6 percent due to less reported incidents of robbery and theft. Other non-index crimes decreased by 8.6 percent while the violation of special laws (e.g. illegal logging, illegal gambling, etc.) ballooned by 66.7 percent.</p>

				<p>Other non-index crimes, theft and physical injury comprised the highest share to total crimes recorded every quarter for the entire region.</p>

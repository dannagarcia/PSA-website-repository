				<h4 style="color:red;">BLISTT area retains status as the least poor in CAR </h4>
				<p>BLISTT area keeps its status as among the least poor city and municipalities in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). This is according to the latest Small Area Estimates (SAE) of poverty prepared by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). BLISTT refers to Baguio City and the adjacent Benguet municipalities of La Trinidad, Itogon, Sablan, Tuba and Tublay. Five-group cluster analysis was performed using the 90% confidence interval of poverty incidence among population (1= bottom/poorest cluster and 5 = least poor cluster).</p>

				<p>In the BLISTT, Tublay is the only municipality outside Cluster 5 although it is the most improved in Metro Baguio followed by Sablan and Tuba that decreased by 10.1 and 9.6 percentage points respectively. Baguio City, La Trinidad and Itogon consistently belong in the least poor cluster since 2006.</p>

				<p>Among the uppermost cluster (Cluster 5), only 3 municipalities are outside Baguio City and Benguet Province: Tabuk City and Rizal in Kalinga and Sagada in Mountain Province. Coming from Cluster 2 in 2009, Sagada is the most improved. Bokod in Benguet and Rizal in Kalinga also made a considerable improvement moving two clusters up.

				Another 5 Benguet municipalities comprise Cluster 4. Kabayan and Buguias are the most improved climbing up from Cluster 1, followed by Atok and Kapangan coming from Cluster 2. In total, 11 out of 13 muncipalities of Benguet are among the least poor areas in the region, leaving out only Kibungan and Bakun.

				In the bottom cluster, there are 24 municipalities and half are in Abra, 4 in Apayao, 4 in Ifugao and 2 each in Kalinga and Mountain Province. Only 8 municipalities in the cluster decreased their poverty incidence with Bucloc in Abra exhibiting the biggest decline while the others became poorer.</p>

				</p>
				<p>The areas that slid far down from Cluster 3 are Conner and Pudtol in Apayao, Hungduan in Ifugao and Pasil in Kalinga. The other 5 municipalities that slid down from a higher cluster (Cluster 2) are Tanudan in Kalinga, Sadanga in Mt. Province, Luba in Abra, Aguinaldo in Ifugao, and Calanasan in Apayao.</p>

				<p>Out of the 24 municipalities in Cluster 1, 11 remained in the poorest cluster since 2006.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Technical Note: Cluster analysis was used to compare the performance of the cities/municipalities. Straight ranking is not advisable due to the overlapping confidence intervals of the various poverty estimates. Cluster 5 areas have poverty incidence 10% and below; Cluster 4, 11% to 20%; Cluster 3, 21% to 30%; Cluster 2, 31% to 40%; and Cluster 1, above 40%.</p>

				<h4 style="color:red;">SPES beneficiaries in CAR increased by 38% in 2011</h4>

				<p>The number of individual beneficiaries under the Special Program for Employment of Students (SPES) of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) increased by 37.9%, from 3,080 in 2010 to 4,248 in 2011.</p>

				<p>The number of beneficiaries almost tripled in Baguio City from the previous year with 170.4% increase in 2011 employing more than one thousand students (see Table 1). This was the first time the city had the most SPES beneficiaries in the region since 2003. The previous biggest employers were Kalinga (2003-2005), Ifugao (2006) and Benguet (2007-2010).</p>

				<p>The province of Abra also recorded a notable increase of 128.7% in 2011, however its share in total SPES employment in the region was only 9% (see Figure 1). All other provinces posted an increase in the number of beneficiaries in the said program except the provinces of Benguet and Mt. Province where they decreased by 8.4% and 2.3% respectively.</p>

				<p>The SPES program is dominated by female recipients with an average percentage share of 63.5% for the past 5 years. It was only in 2005 & 2006 that male beneficiaries outnumbered their female counterparts (see Table 2 and Figure 2).</p>

				<p>According to DOLE, the objective of the SPES is to develop the intellectual capacities of children of poor families and harness their potentials for the country's well being. Specifically, the program aims to help poor but deserving students pursue their education by providing income or augment their income through encouraging their employment during summer and/or Christmas vacations .</p>

				<p>The SPES is open to all qualified high school, college or vocational students or drop-outs and interested employers who are any person or entity who has employed at least 50 workers at any given time during the past 12 months.</p>

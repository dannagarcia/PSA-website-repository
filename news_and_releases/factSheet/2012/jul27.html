				<h4>Cordillera economy decelerates in 2011</h4>

				<p>The economy of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), as measured by the Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP), decelerated to 2.1 percent in 2011 from 6.3 percent the previous year. The slowing down of the economy was due to the decelerated growth of the Industry sector.</p>

				<p>The Industry sector accounted for the bulk of the region's economy with a share of 53.0 percent in 2011, slightly lower than its 53.1 percent share in 2010. The Service sector's share was 36.4 percent, an increase from its year-ago share of 36.2 percent. Meanwhile, AHFF accounted for the lowest share at 10.6 percent â€“ lower than its 10.8 percent share the previous year.</p>

				</p>

				<p>The Industry sector decelerated from 8.6 percent in 2010 to 1.9 percent in 2011. The sector was kept in a positive growth due to the positive growth of Manufacturing, the major contributor to Industry, but the subsector suffered a marked slowdown from 10.3 percent increase in 2010 to 4.3 percent in 2011. The Electricity, Gas and Water Supply subsector also slowed down from 7.0 percent in 2010 to 3.1 percent in 2011. Meanwhile, Mining and Quarrying sank deeper to negative 11.4 percent from negative 0.3 percent due to the decline of gold production. Moreover, the Construction subsector suffered a reversal in growth from a 4.1 percent growth in 2010 to a negative 6.0 percent in 2011 due to subdued public construction.</p>

				<p>The Service sector also slowed down from 5.8 percent in 2010 to 2.9 percent in 2011. The Other Services (Education, Hotels & Restaurants and Medical Services) subsector cushioned the slow down with a remarkable increase of 9.3 percent in 2011, almost four times its growth of 2.4 percent in 2010. Real Estate, Renting and Business Activities (RERBA) also continued to accelerate from 3.8 percent in 2010 to an increase of 5.6 percent in 2011 with the help of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) activities. The other subsectors increased but on slower paces except Financial Intermediation which suffered a sharp reversal from a double digit growth of 24.6 percent in 2010 to a negative 7.7 percent in 2011, and Public Administration from 5.9 percent to negative 3.0 percent.</p>

				<p>The AHFF sector had slowly reeled from the damages of Typhoon Pepeng and posted a modest growth of 0.4 percent in 2011 from a negative growth of 2.7 percent in 2010. The Fishery subsector showed a big reversal in growth from a negative 17.9 percent growth in 2010 to 3.1 percent in 2011 while Agriculture and Forestry also rebounded from negative 2.5 percent in 2010 to 0.3 percent in 2011 .</p>

				<p>The Service sector was the highest contributor to the region's economic growth rate in 2011 with 1.1 percentage points followed by Industry that contributed 1.0 percentage points . AHFF contributed the least with only 0.04 percentage points.</p>
